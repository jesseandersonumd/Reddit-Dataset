Hello everyone! I am taking Bio 1015 (completely online) this quarter. I know classes are different so this is what Bio 1015 is at my school:

MICROBIOLOGY & IMMUNOLOGY
This course introduces the student to microorganisms with particular emphasis on their role in health, wellness, and disease. Economic, social, and cultural issues related to utilization, control and research of Monera, Protista, fungi, bacteria, and viruses are also considered.

I'm on my second chapter and we have to do 2 chapters a week. I didn't do too great on my Chapter 1 quiz and I need to figure out what I can do differently. My second chapter is due tomorrow so I have a lot of work to do.

Anyways, it doesn't matter how many times I read a chapter, if you ask me a question about it my mind draws a blank. I tried making flash cards but had over 100 and I don't think that's utilizing my time correctly and its basically just as much reading. Maybe I'm doing it wrong? How can I effectively learn my chapters? Any tips or tricks?

Discussion posts,2,j5yqnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j5yqnk/discussion_posts/,4,How do people keep up with discussion posts? All of mine fall on Monday and I’ve had a paper every other week. Professors assign about thirty-fifty pages of reading per week (I have four classes and this adds up to about one-twenty to two hundred pages per week of reading) and bi monthly (twice a month) quizzes so not reading something is impossible. I’m normally an A student but I’m coasting on Cs this semester which is mind blowing to me.

My Study Tips as a 4.0 Biology Pre-Med Senior in College.,1712,gu2w6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gu2w6f/my_study_tips_as_a_40_biology_premed_senior_in/,107,"
My Study Tips as a 4.0 Senior in College

Hey guys so I wanted to make a post that I hope will help some of you with how to maximize studying efficiency and increase your chance at getting straight A’s in med school pre reqs and college in general.

Study tip 1: Prioritize Classes, each class and individual professor has a level of difficulty and importance to your overall college career. Prioritize classes with high importance (pre reqs and major requirements) over other less important classes. Additionally, prioritize classes that appear more difficult over those that are less difficult.

Study tip 2: Balance your schedule with 1-3 difficult classes and 1-2 moderate to easy classes. This will help you not get too overwhelmed.

Study tip 3: For clases which are heavy on memorization, space out studying the two weeks before a test one hour each day. As the exam approaches, study for longer stretches of time the week before, reviewing sections of material. The three days before an exam do a Meta Review of all material, three consecutive days. This will maximize information retention and give you both the nitty gritty details and the overall picture. As you do the meta review try and explain concepts to yourself in your head. 
Note: I only use this study technique for very difficult or important classes as it is somewhat labor intensive and takes up a bit of time. 

Study tip 4: Go to class, oftentimes a profesor will point out things they want you to pay close attention to or that they think is important, remember you are not only taking X course, you are taking X course with your specific professor.... simply knowing the material is not enough, you must also know what your professor wants of you.

Study tip 5: Use rate my professor.
When possible use rate my profesor to find professors that have positive reviews. Sometimes bad professors are unavoidable, but don’t make your life any harder than it is by getting someone who doesn’t know how to teach to their strengths.

Study tip 6: Form a study group and take turns attempting to teach each other sections of the material. Teaching a subject is the best way to learn it, I have used this technique to great effect with my fellow study partners. I also found this very helpful for concept heavy classes such as organic chemistry and parts of Biochemistry.

Study tip 7: Be proactive, do not wait until the last minute to turn in an assignment, turn it in days or weeks before if possible. Last minute deadlines can cause unnecessary stress and can be annoying if something else comes up. Do yourself a favor and don’t procrastinate.

Study tip 8: Utilize your time efficiently. If you find that you spend a lot of time on your phone or watching TV at a certain time of the day, utilize this time to instead go over some material or get some EC’s, Research, etc. done. This will give you more time to be productive during the day. Additionally, try and give the appropriate amount of time during the week to classes you find difficult and less time to those you find easy or do well in. Do not spend too much time on classes that you don’t need to.

Study tip 9: OVER-PREPARE for the first test. You don’t know how hard a class really is until you are tested on the material. Over study for the first test so that you do well in it. After this point you should have a slight grasp on your abilities and can make a judgement as to how much time is appropriate to get the grade you want on the next test. 

Study tip 10: Go to office hours, these times are invaluable as you can get one on one instruction with either your TAs or Professors. Not only is this good for getting them to know you and perhaps writing good recommendation letters, but it can also give you a leg up in knowing what material they’ll likely test you on or what they want you to focus on. Remember, like I said, you are not only taking X class you are taking X class with a specific professor. The professor is a huge component in the success you may have in a class. Knowing your professor and what they expect from you is an invaluable piece of information.

Study tip 11: For math and physics classes do NOT simply read slides. This will not help. You MUST do practice problems in order to get familiar with the material. There is no other way to learn math other than practice.

Study tip 12: If you do not understand a concept ask for help from your professor or try and find the answer utilizing resources such as your textbook, online databases, or YouTube/Reddit.

Study tip 13: The night before a big exam, go over the information in your head. I don’t know how this works for me but it just does, somehow I manage to capture very specific information while doing this. It might not work for everyone but go ahead and give it a shot and see if it works.

Study tip 14: Study in the library, there will be less distractions and you will feel more productive.

Study tip 15: DO NOT do all nighters, they are the byproduct of under preparation . There is never a reason to do one.

Study tip 16: Look at homework as a learning opportunity not simply an assignment. I can’t even count the times that homework questions have appeared in an altered form within my exams. 

Study tip 17: don’t be afraid of utilizing free tutoring services from your institution.

Study tip 18: Finally, as a last piece of advice, don’t place so much validation or importance on a three digit number. Yes it is important, but ones mental and physical health comes first. If you feel yourself getting burnt out, give your head a break. You are not defined by a three digit number. Do the best you can and you’ll go far. 

I hope this helped whoever reads it. Best of luck to everyone.","['I wish I could have done #2, but I took all the easy classes through dual enrollment in high school.

Though not as a 4.0 student, since I didn’t think it worth the trouble (did make sure to be above the *summa* cutoff, since that's the only thing you leave on a CV past grad school apps -- maybe it's more important for med school, though). IIRC my biology major gpa was around 3.98 though, so perhaps close enough for government work. Here it is for comparative purposes :)\n\n- - -\n\nIn the goal of repurposing old existing content, here are some tips I wrote up a while back to a student asking for suggestions on how to get good grades in college. They probably don’t generalize super well, but they worked well for me in my majors. I’ll also note that post-college success requires much more than great grades, which are neither necessary nor sufficient. In most cases it’s probably better to devote one’s marginal attentions to networking, internships, personal side-projects, research, etc.\n\nAnyway, the tips:\n\n1) Understanding the material when it was presented in lecture. If there was something I didn’t understand, I’d raise my hand (or shout out, depending on the mood) and ask for clarification. If after some short back-and-forth I still didn’t understand, I’d chat with the instructor after class or send them (or the TA) an email. A handful of times I went in for office hours for more directed assistance. I typically did this only for higher level, conceptual things, or if what they said contradicted my earlier understanding. For simpler stuff I just made a note and looked it up on my own time. It always puzzled me how rarely people did this — you have domain expert (a fantastic resource!) being paid to be available to you, why not use them? I’d occasionally try asking students adjacent to me if they understood something the instructor had just covered and they’d reply no — then why not ask!? (they were not socially anxious in other contexts and were otherwise academically conscientious). This applies doubly to more discussion oriented classes (e.g. most of the philosophy classes I took).\n\nIn doing this it was also important to curtail my own weakness for loquacious know-it-all argumentative show-off-iness, and only disrupt the class when I could be reasonably confident in a legitimate deficit in my own understanding that was relevant to the immediate lesson being taught. Having both instructed and TA’d several classes now I think I did a good job back when, judging by what I see in my own students — sometimes I get one who’ll derail the class with random stuff and I need to deflect and steer us back to the lesson, but almost always questions result in illuminating discussions of related tangentia or let me clarify a tricky concept that lots of people in the class are struggling with. Also good for linking lessons to things that are relevant or interesting in the students’ own lives.\n\n2) Related to the above, but when the instructor’s asked a question and nobody’s answered, and their eyes desperately scan the room for some bare hint of engagement — offer up your own thoughts! Don’t be shy! Even if — especially if — you’re not certain of your answer or are insecure in your understanding of the topic. Wear your ignorance like a badge! Show it to everyone that they might more easily remove it! I found that sort of real-time feedback to be invaluable to the learning process.\n\n3) To study for exams, I’d look through my notes from class (never really bothered with textbooks, though I would google around if I didn’t understand something and skim through any supplemental, optional papers the professor tossed online; and ofc I’d use textbooks for self-study topics) and take notes on my notes, essentially condensing 30+ pages of writing into 2-3, focusing on things that I found “surprising” (i.e. didn’t remember offhand during review). I would read these over every other night in the week leading up to the exam. Occasionally I’d carry them around with me and try to remember things from them throughout the day during downtime, e.g. waiting on an elevator. Sort of a sloppy implementation of spaced repetition.\n\n4) Every test I took I took 3-4 times, doing my best to forget my answers from earlier rounds, and then later comparing versions and making note of any discrepancies. Caught lots of silly reading comprehension-type mistakes this way, basic math errors, etc. This is sort of a “wisdom of the crowds” approach except the crowds are comprised of slightly different time-displaced versions of yourself.\n\n5) When learning new things, I’d try to integrate them into what I already knew as best I could, so that no facts or concepts would be memorized completely unconnected to anything else. I also read a lot of stuff indirectly related to whatever I was studying formally at the time, which was good for identifying connections later. I tried to make sure my understanding was the sort I could explain to someone else, or reproduce from scratch if need be (e.g. if reading about an experiment, I’d try to understand it well enough that I could replicate it and the authors’ analyses myself). Basically rubber duck debugged my own miscomprehension.\n\n6) I read essay/exam prompts carefully and asked about anything important-seeming I found ambiguous. A lot of the times the teacher’s desiderata are spelled out very explicitly (and nowadays I give for everything a very detailed grading rubric) but people often avoid reading them completely. When they’re not a quick email resolves ambiguities trivially.\n\n7) Pay attention to feedback, and always seek feedback out when it’s offered but not required. As an example, I’ll assign students an essay, due in 5 weeks. I’ll tell them (and write in the syllabus and lecture notes) that I’m happy to sit down with them and give them feedback on their essay, but the amount of feedback I give will be proportional to the amount of time left before the essay’s due. If they give me a draft with four weeks to spare, I’ll grade the essay completely, up to and incl. line edits, and tell them exactly what they need to do to improve it and get an A+. Two weeks out, I’m happy to read it over, let them know where they were strong and where they were weak at the paragraph resolution and what they should focus on for revisions. A day out I can give a thumbs up or thumbs down but not much more. Inevitably half the students never bother to send me any drafts, and of those that do the overwhelming majority do so in the last week."", 'Go Gators', 'I glanced at a random tip and read go to class.

My Advice for Students during COVID,21,igipl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/igipl1/my_advice_for_students_during_covid/,4,"I'm a professor and run a blog/Instagram account for college students called - The Student Collective. I put together this list of tips for students as they begin a new semester during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

1. **Know your university’s policies.** Many universities and professors are making changes to their policies to accommodate these extenuating circumstances. Check out your university’s COVID guidelines as well as notes in your course syllabi and announcements from your professors. Some things to watch for - Are there extended drop/add periods? Are there alternatives for grading such as a pass/fail option? Are your professor’s assignment deadlines strict or suggested? Keep these in mind as you go forward in your semester. Be sure to bookmark this page for quick reference should any issues come up! 
2. **Create a sick plan.** Despite taking all recommended precautions - wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, limiting your outings - there is still a chance you could become infected with COVID-19. It is so important that you are familiar with [the symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and the procedures of your health center and/or doctor’s office should you develop symptoms. Additionally, you should have a plan in place should you need to quarantine from being exposed or becoming ill. Things to consider in your sick plan:

* A contact person - a friend, roommate, or family member - to check in on your wellbeing and help if needed 
* Health/medical supplies - thermometer, insurance card, big water jug, Ibuprofen, ice packs, kleenex
* A comfortable place to quarantine and things to keep you entertained (computer charger, phone charger, books, puzzles)
* Quick, easy, nutritious meals that you keep in stock should the need arrive (frozen fruit for smoothies, quick meals, soups, or pasta, Gatorades)
* Contact information for notifying your professors, boss, university officials, etc. at the onset of your illness/quarantine

**3. Tap into your university’s resources.** Many services that are typically offered at your university are now adapting to an online version but they are still available to you. Your school gym might be offering online fitness classes; your mental health center might be offering virtual counseling sessions, and the writing center might be giving one-on-one virtual coaching. Universities might have technological equipment such as laptops for you to borrow and campus organizations might be holding virtual meetups. Tap into these resources! You’re already paying for them - put them to use!

4.**Have a COVID discussion with the people you live with.** It is essential that you have a conversation with the people you live with about boundaries, rules and expectations for one another during this season in order to protect everyone’s safety and comfort. Where is it okay to go? Who is it okay to interact with? What are the rules about keeping your home safe? What is the protocol for when you come back into the home after being outside? Each decision one of you makes could potentially affect the other so it is important that everyone is on the same page. You can also revisit this topic throughout the semester as the situation evolves.

5. **Stay informed.** It is valuable to keep an eye on[ the COVID data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) for your community as well as the policies that officials are putting in place. While overload of this type of data can be detrimental, it is necessary that you are vigilant in order to protect yourself and the rest of your community. 

6. **Pay attention to trends in your health and wellbeing.** While COVID-19 is presenting as a huge threat to our health, we cannot neglect the other pieces of our wellbeing while in quarantine. It is important to monitor your mood, activity level, sleep, and diet and make changes accordingly to maintain your wellbeing. I’ve started tracking my food and sleep using the FitBit app, and I have been going on daily walks in addition to my daily workouts to make sure I am still moving my body and getting some fresh air and Vitamin D. Find ways to still maintain your wellbeing and don’t hesitate to contact your doctor if you notice any alarming or drastic trends in your health. 

7. **Monitor and care for your mental health.** As someone who has a history of anxiety, OCD, and depression, I know all too well the dangers that this type of reality presents for our mental health. Keep track of your thoughts and feelings and notice any shifts in your mentality and wellbeing. Remember that our thoughts can lie to us! It’s important to have a proactive strategy in place to confront negative or unproductive feelings and reframe, redirect or dispel them from your mind. I will be sharing another blog post soon about the different mental strategies I have been using during this time that have helped me tremendously. Lastly remember that action is the best antidote for anxiety and depression. So when you feel those doubting or sinking thoughts creep in, propel yourself into action: begin your schoolwork, go for a walk or do a workout, call a friend. These actions will not only distract you from your thoughts, but they will replace them with a better feeling. As always, if you have thoughts of harming yourself or others or feelings/experiences that are extremely dark, dangerous, or uncomfortable, make contact with a mental health professional and/or reach out to someone you trust.

8. **Take charge of your quarantine life.** While COVID is putting a huge strain on what we had envisioned 2020 to look like, it does not mean we have to sit this entire year out. We can still have a fruitful, joyful, productive year, but it is up to us to create a productive, happy “new normal” and hold ourselves accountable. Take control of your schedule, your mindset, and your priorities and build for yourself a meaningful 2020.

9. **Use this time to your advantage.** Many of us have suffered from feeling a lack of control in this situation. This thing is happening around us, happening to us, and we are simply in survival mode. How could you make this season work for you rather than against you? It might be a time to take all of those hard classes and get them out of the way. Maybe you decide to take the year off from school to work and save money. Maybe you’ve been in desperate need of a break to relax and recharge or heal from some of the challenges you’ve faced recently. Or did you ever have an idea in the back of your head but you never found the time to dedicate to it? Such as a side hustle you wanted to start or health/fitness goals that you wanted to achieve or learning how to cook or paint. Could it be now?

How could you come out of this season stronger, more authentic, more productive, and closer to achieving your goals?

In a relationship? Plan an in-house date night. Get dressed up and cook a fancy meal. Single but wanting to mingle? Dating is not canceled! Keep swiping, messaging, and offer a Facetime date. This is the true test of compatibility! Sad you’re not able to travel this year? (This is me!) Do all of the research and plan the trip of your dreams for when the world opens up again!

Help with Online FOMO,15,iam1we,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iam1we/help_with_online_fomo/,6,"I am the mother of an incoming freshman this fall. Because of the ongoing pandemic, my daughter and I (along with her father) decided that she will be staying home for the fall semester. With the loss of her high school graduation and the beginning of her freshman year ruined, she's been extremely distraught for the past couple months but was on a positive upward trend until a couple days ago, when she saw all of her peers moving on campus. 

She feels like she's missing out and I keep telling her that the spring semester will be here before she knows it, which is when I promised her she'll be able to be independent no matter the circumstances. But she's still pretty bummed and I'm not sure what other advice I can give her. I just want her to be happy, for her to know she made the right decision (though it may not seem like it), and for her to stay focused and not let the situation decline her mental health anymore than it has (since the pandemic started, I got her a therapist and she has been diagnosed with anxiety and ptsd; like I said, this whole situation has been very tough for her).

Does anyone have advice or tips on how she can get through these upcoming four months and not let her FOMO take over?","[""She's going to feel the way she feels regardless. At that age it's pretty common to compare your situation to others and feel lesser because you aren't living in that same situation. \n\nRealistically, she isn't going to be missing much at all.

Dispute Over Measure on Suing Colleges,2,huzblh,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/huzblh/dispute_over_measure_on_suing_colleges/,1,"The main umbrella group representing colleges, which have been worried about being sued by students and workers if they become ill when campuses reopen, was pleased with a summary of a proposal being considered by Senate Republicans to make it significantly more difficult to file coronavirus-related lawsuits against colleges, K-12 schools, charities and businesses.

But the summary, obtained by Inside Higher Ed on Friday, was panned by student groups and Senate Democrats who worried it would lessen incentives on the entities to take the necessary steps to keep students, workers and customers safe.


“It’s pretty horrifying. It’s just as bad as we feared, maybe worse,” said Molly Coleman, executive director of the People’s Parity Project, a national group of law students and new lawyers organizing a petition drive on 15 campuses calling on institutions to oppose liability protection.

According to the two-page summary, Republicans are proposing to temporarily raise the standard in personal action lawsuits, so that colleges and other entities would only be held liable for “gross negligence or intentional misconduct” -- a higher bar than in state courts, where those being sued need only prove that they acted reasonably.

Among other changes, the proposal would also require that plaintiffs show “clear and convincing evidence,” as opposed to the current preponderance of evidence standard, in which arguments tip toward one side or the other. It would also protect the entities from being investigated for violating federal labor laws, as long as they followed public health guidelines, and would cap the damages that could be awarded.

Because Congress cannot change the standard state courts use, the proposal would also allow either side to have cases heard in federal court, which would use the stricter standards, said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education.

ACE, as well as business groups, had been seeking temporary protection from lawsuits, and according to the summary, the higher standards would last only until the lifting of the national state of emergency during the pandemic or 2024, whichever comes later.

According to the summary, the changes would only apply to personal injury cases, not others, like lawsuits being brought against colleges over refunding room and board or student fees. McDonough said institutions have not been asking for those suits to be included.

ACE and other groups, including teachers' unions, were waiting for a more detailed actual proposal, expected as soon as today.

“We’re hopeful, though, that it will create immediate, temporary and limited protections from COVID-19 exposure liability,” McDonough said.

Groups representing higher education institutions had said the problem with the current standard is that what is considered to be acting reasonably is hazy, particularly because federal and state governments have not laid out clear requirements for what is expected.

“Schools are between a rock and a hard place,” McDonough said. “They need some confidence that each decision they make won’t become a lawsuit magnet. But, as we are seeing from daily news reports across the country, colleges can’t count on clear, consistent guidance from their local, state and federal authorities.”

He pointed to the lawsuit Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, filed Thursday against Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and the city’s council members over the city’s mask-wearing requirement. “Imagine being a leader at an Atlanta college today, trying to make some decisions about whether and where face masks must be worn on campus,” McDonough said.

However, in a press call on Friday, the Senate’s top Democrat, New York senator Chuck Schumer, said the proposal appeared to be written by business lobbyists, but he vowed Democrats would put “workers first.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said liability protection is essential to get Republican support. But illustrating the partisan divide that needs to be bridged for a package to get through Congress, Schumer said he is demanding a package as large as the $3 trillion proposal the Democratic House passed, called the HEROES Act. ""If they come up with a skimpy offer, it's not going to be enough,"" Schumer told reporters. ""We're going to fight for the entire HEROES bill. Period.""

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said colleges would not have to worry about getting sued if they act responsibly. ""If colleges reopen in a safe, reasonable, and responsible way, and make clear commitments to students, faculty, and staff about their plans, then they don’t need extra legal protections from Congress,"" she said in a statement. ""Instead of trying to shield everyone from liability, Senate Republicans need to help make sure colleges have the resources they need to reopen safely. ""

Georgetown University law professor David Vladeck, who argued against creating a shield against coronavirus liability at a Senate judiciary committee hearing in May, said in an email Friday that the standard being proposed would go beyond engaging in risky activity or acting irresponsibly.

For example, he said, what if a college didn't do contact tracing consistently and didn't tell a student that they had been in contact with someone who was infected by the virus and ended up in the hospital? They might have a case to say the college didn't take reasonable steps, but they would not be able to prove they were grossly negligent or intentionally tried to get the student sick.

Vladeck said also that seeking the protection is the wrong message to send when students and parents may be nervous about returning to campuses. ""While it may provide incentives for schools to open campuses, it will also be a deterrent for parents to let their kids go off to school,"" he said. ""Broad immunity says to students, 'Return to campus at your peril. Your school cannot be held accountable unless the school is taking deliberate action to hurt you, or is so utterly disengaged that it is failing to take basic precautions.' What a message to send.""

Kyle Southern, a lobbyist for Young Invincibles, a millennial advocacy group, raised concerns about weakening the ability of students or college workers to sue, particularly as the infections are rising rapidly in some parts of the country.

""We can't see a way this broadening of liability protection serves to protect students -- our primary focus -- or the faculty and staff who make campuses work. Providing further incentive to rush to reopen could encourage a competitive impulse among institutions that could be detrimental to students' well-being.""

I wanted to share some tips for success in college...,2,hwtnhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hwtnhf/i_wanted_to_share_some_tips_for_success_in_college/,0,"Whew, college! While it is challenging, you get what you put in, and you want to make sure those years paid off. I wanted to share some tips that worked for me (and also tips that I wish I followed).

\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\* I understand that each person is faced with their own unique circumstances, and not everything works for everyone. These tips are just general, I hope someone finds them useful, but I understand if not. \*\*END DISCLAIMER\*\*

First, take time to get to know the area. Where everything is located, how you'll go through your daily routine. Do your research on your college's website - look at different organizations and activities, pick a few that you'd like to try out.

(I am not qualified to give mental health advice, but I would just raise the suggestion that you address any issues that you may be dealing with. Make sure you're mentally prepared to take good care of yourself and devote the effort needed to succeed. Unresolved mental health issues can really hold one back. See if there is a trustworthy, affordable counselor on campus. If that's not an option, the one thing I can suggest is to reduce your toxic friendships.)

Start developing good habits, like regular organized studying, communicating with professors (attending office hours, proper email etiquette) , taking good care of yourself (sleep, healthy food, exercise, de-stressing), and connecting with new people. The sooner you get used to taking charge and being organized, the easier it will be for you to make time for new, enriching activities.

I compiled a list of study tips ([https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back\_to\_school\_homework\_studying\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/hn7cp1/back_to_school_homework_studying_tips/)).

Get yourself into the right #mindset. **Learn, work, connect, opportunity.** You (likely) went to college in order to learn and succeed, so work hard and be on the lookout for connections and opportunities! Don't try to rush to get your degree done! While grades are important, experience and initiative are more significant in advancing your career.

If you have a specific career goal in mind, read about what it takes to stand out as an applicant, and start figuring out how you'll fit these activities in your schedule. For example as a Medical school applicant

If you aren't set on a specific goal, you should try different activities, and see what resonates with you. Don't disqualify yourself or assume that you aren't interested in a certain profession UNTIL you get some exposure to the field. It might be more fun than it sounds!

HOWEVER, it is possible that you're initially set on a certain job, but then lose interest. Just make sure you try something that's outside of your main interest.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Get involved in organizations, and try a leadership position. You will be able to connect with people with similar goals and ask them questions. A leadership position will test you and the experience will highlight you as a job applicant.

If you are unsure of your goals, try figuring out some possible professions, or at least eliminating ones that you really don't like. Try **job shadowing and/or volunteering** in different fields. Doing this helped me eliminate engineering and pharmacy school...a job may be very different in person compared to the description.

Try to work somewhere, at least part-time, on or near campus. Working will help you prove that you're dependable and a good employee. Not to mention $$$ comes in handy!

Try **undergraduate research**, at least try a semester! You can connect with professors and classmates, learn skills, and boost your CV/resume.

Apply for summer **internships.**

This might sound cliche but give yourself a break and have fun sometimes. If people invite you out for a fun activity, join them once in a while! Party party just be careful!

Thanks for reading, and please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions! Have a great day! :)",[],7/24/20 6:38
Failed classes (3! Withdrew from 1) for the first time. I’m frustrated with myself and no longer feel motivated to enroll for future semesters.,3,gq5cy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gq5cy4/failed_classes_3_withdrew_from_1_for_the_first/,9,"Let me start by saying this... I failed 3 of my 4 classes (with the exception of 1 class, being that I withdrew, but that is mostly irrelevant) for this spring semester due to procrastination and health issues (at the end), however this is probably all my fault.

I have never failed a class in my academic life (IIRC), let alone failed multiple in one semester - and I’m hating myself for it.

Currently, I’m a “freshman” in (community) college, and I’ve been told not to be this hard in myself being that I’m early in this, and also because it was already unusual for me to have to do the rest of my semester online due to our times of a growing pandemic, but I don’t want to believe that. 
I set out major goals for myself: to get good grades for this semester, to improve my cumulative GPA through those grades because fall semester wasn’t so great due to procrastination (no surprise there), and to not have to fall behind a semester/graduate within a set timeframe (my plan is to transfer to a university). Additionally, I wanted to CONQUER this procrastination issue. I’ve automatically failed to achieve all of these goals, and feel like I’ve let myself down hard.

When my College transitioned to online classes, my procrastination started to take its maximum toll. I got tips to try and minimize it, but they didn’t work long term. What gets me even more mad is that once I withdrew from my most overwhelming course, I started to prioritize work from another course that was close to that level and that I specifically did NOT want to retake, at all. I basically broke my sleeping schedule and lost hours of sleep doing it only to end up with a splitting headache several times (and other things) trying to complete a big project to pass, after procrastinating on it for way too long. I was even lucky enough to get another chance from the instructor for this course. I ended up having to stop because of the health issues.

I honestly don’t feel like I want to enroll anymore. I’ve let myself down hard with all of this, and now falling behind is going to stay deep in my conscience if I continue. I kind of feel like quitting college now. I don’t know. Maybe I am being too hard on myself? Where do you guys think I can go with this case now?

TL;DR:
I’ve failed 3 classes (withdrew 1) this spring semester after not failing a class ever, and failed to achieve all my major goals (see second paragraph) I’ve set to reach, and I don’t feel I have a chance to get back on track for any of them - partly due to health issues, but majorly due to procrastination. I’m very frustrated in myself and feel like quitting college. Embarrassed. Am I being too hard on myself?","[""If higher education is your goal then you shouldnt give up! At the same time it's ok to take a break if you dont what you want. I'm finally transferring as a non traditional student. I did not really have any direct io n in HS and ended up doing a volunteer year after graduation and then a stint in the military. When I finally went to classes fill time I did alright the first semester but suffered the next semester (a lit of this was due to time mismangement) I ended up failing intermediate algebra, and while the CC counselor offered to switch me to a lower level class, I was determined to retake the class, even though it meant delaying my transfer process another year. \n\nThe point of this is there are ways to combat procrastination and persevere. I always like to reccomend the youtube channel Thomas Frank. Time management is a learned skill so you should take the time to learn what works for you. Yes its embarrassing, yes it sucks to fail but you owe it to yourself to overcome those failures. When I failed my math class it completely changed the way I worked on assignments and studied in my other classes. It wasnt because I was inately good at the subjects but because of the work I put in to learn how to really manage my academics."", 'I failed an entire semester once due to mental and physical health issues (0.83 GPA for the term). \n\nI also graduated with a 3.3ish despite that and got into grad school for my masters degree where I have a 4.0 so far. \n\nLife is weird and it happens. If you think this bad semester was a blip that you can overcome, than it’s just a blip. If it’s due to some fundamental nature of yours that you can’t ever change, then maybe college isn’t for you. But I’m willing to bet that you’re just in a rough patch right now. A lot of people are, you’re in good company. \n\nEvery semester is a fresh start. Also, there’s no better feeling than thinking you can’t make up for a stupid mistake like this and then blasting past it to the point where it isn’t even relevant anymore. I promise. It’s like those clips of people putting sunglasses on while walking away from an explosion. The explosion is all of 2020 and you are going to be thriving even if only out of spite.', ""Yes you are being too hard on yourself.\n\nI almost failed the most important intro series for my major because of procrastination + some stupid shit I did to myself that distracted me during classes.\n\nI was also super discouraged. I felt like I was never going to dig myself out of the hole. Frankly, I don't really know what really turned the table around. Maybe it's because I moved closer to school, or maybe I stopped doing all the dumb, distracting shit I was doing.\n\nSo I'd start by figuring out what leads you to your main problem, which is procrastination. Every time you end up procrastinating instead of studying, trace back to when you started procrastinating and avoid that behavior/situation altogether.\n\nOnce you get rid of your triggers, all you need is just one good class that will boost your confidence. I got my very first B+ in my intro bio 3. Although it wasn't an A, it was a huge jump from my previous intro bio class. It gave me hope that I can succeed if I really try. After that, I guess something kind of clicked and I consistently performed well except in couple classes I took during my painful breakup.\n\nI didn't go to CC, but I'm sure the type of institution doesn't really matter. Identifying what's wrong and trying to improve should work regardless of where you are. If you put the work in, it will get better. Good luck!!"", 'Look into if you can appeal the grades for a Excused Withdrawal.\n\nThis is a weird time, and especially if you can document any of the health issues on top of a lot of community colleges offering EW through the end of the semester, may be able to appeal for it.\n\nWhile it sucks to fail, this is also just a sucky time and you are not alone in struggling. It would not be unreasonable to put your education plans on hold until after this has blown over if you are not feeling the online system is working or fulfilling for you and are able to do so.

How I Managed College and Grad School Debt Free (Advice and Spreadsheet),32,geyfpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/geyfpg/how_i_managed_college_and_grad_school_debt_free/,6,"Below is a spreadsheet breakdown of the aggregate costs and funding I received in order to fund my education.

**Why I am Posting this?**  

My hope is that this might help students in budgeting, knowing where to look for funding, and how they might save some money. 

**Are you attempting to illustrate any point or draw any conclusions about the state of college in the US?**

No, college cost in the US is incredibly varied (mostly a bad setup) and each individual has their own experience. FWIW, I believe the US Government should fund college tuition/fees for all students despite paying/earning my own way for the most part. I am not attempting to shame anyone here.

**Is your experience indicative of others?**

Yes and no. I avoided major expenses by living at home through undergrad and splitting rent afterwards. However, it is important to note that even adding in split rent for undergrad years, I would still be debt-free. My cost of living is also lower than some people as I don't eat out much, don't party that often, and limit expenses to the best of my ability. 

**What did you exclude from this cost breakdown?**

I excluded my job income from sources not tied to tuition costs itself. I also excluded costs like buying a car (I had a very cheap one going into college and purchased a newer one in Grad Year 1). The Cost of Books/Insurance/Food/Clothes/Gas are essentially a Misc section of expenses. These are estimates but I have gone back and looked at my debit records to get a fair estimate. 

**Do you have any tips for college students pertaining to funding?**

*Scout Everything-* Scout scholarships, scout internships, scout the people hiring you, scout scholarship committees if possible. I have seen great students miss on big opportunities and not so great students win big because they took the time to scout. I will say something unpopular here, but scouting matters just as much if not more than how smart you are or how hard you work. I was a B student in high school and my work ethic is good, but not great. So if I can do it, most others can to. 

*Your Circle of Influence Matters-* Make friends with faculty and make sure the other students you hang around are people who you not only like, but are high achieving and driven individuals. I have walked right into major funding that would have been impossible to find online just because a friend or colleague mentioned it in passing. 

*Leadership v Grades-* Should you focus more on grades or leadership positions? This answer is tough, but both. Your grades need to be decent, but if you have no leadership activities then you aren't winning many scholarships even with a 4.0. Honor Societies, Student Government, and Federal Internships/Programs are great places to get both experience and scholarships. 

*Work and School-* Another question people ask a lot is how much should I work or should I at all? I have had semesters where I have not worked at all and a semester where I worked 55 hours a week. Find something in the middle. For most of us, we have to work and it is a good lesson in dual tasking and balancing responsibilities. I find a happy medium at about 20-25 hours a week. 

*RateMyProfessor-* I know there are mixed opinions on RMP over this subreddit. However, I will say this. An incoming freshman in nearly any major who uses RMP to help pick instructors will end with a higher GPA than one who just picks randomly. It definitely helped me keep my GPA competitive for scholarships. 

*Textbooks-* Honestly, if I could change one thing about the way I spent money in college, it might be as it pertains to textbook use. Around half of all textbooks I bought, I did not use. Talk to people who took the class, look at RMP, email the professor, and see if you can share with a friend. Also, look for online or e-versions which may be cheaper (these are easier for studying with imo, though some people prefer physical copies and I totally get that). 

&#x200B;

**What about school rank? You went to a community college? Do these matter?**

I was lucky enough to be in a state that offers two free years of community college (in fact I was part of the inaugural class). So when I chose to go to community college, I did it for a couple of reasons. It was cheaper, my grades in high school were middling, and I was unsure of what I wanted to major in. Community College is a fantastic value for the money and I have never had someone openly say anything negative about it on my resume. Also, a community college doesn't limit your ability to go to other schools. Here is my academic journey in a nutshell. I made more friends in community college than Uni FWIW. 

2015-2017 Local Community College

2017-2019 State University (Graduated with Bachelors in Political Science)

2019-2020 Top 15 University (Graduated with Graduate Certificate) Via Federal Funding

2019-2021 (Ranked Well in Program) State University (Will Graduate with Masters in Public Health)

A very large portion of your income (ignoring grad because that\'s irrelevant for undergrads), comes from scholarships. Some are state-based, some are academic performance, and at least one (McNair) is for URM. Your average college student won\'t have access to practically any of those. And you purposely left out most of your work hours/earnings, which is what the majority of students rely on, not scholarships.\n\nI was also supported through university by scholarships that increased in value each year, and ended my degree with $40,000 in savings. But these scholarships and awards are a case of ""those who have, get more"". I was given awards based on academic achievement. I was given scholarships based on academic achievement. And then both of those things made me more competitive in future applications. Things could have been very different had I not been awarded a $4000 scholarship for my first year of study.\n\nBut let\'s be absolutely clear here: there was only one award and one major scholarship available each year in my field and I cleared them, meaning no other student could. No one else in my year could have followed my path at the same time. This applies generally too: a very small number of people will get a lot of big scholarships to cover the costs, and the rest of the student body can\'t do the same because those scholarships aren\'t there or they\'re not competitive for them.\n\nSo some slightly better advice might be: go hard early on because it becomes exponentially harder to find funding and opportunities the longer you wait. Get awards on your CV/resume early.', ""Joking: How dare you cheat the loan companies out of making money off your student debt????  LOL\n\nSeriously: Thank you for posting a very clear statement of how to do it without debt for others to see and hopefully follow.\n\nCongratulations on a job well done!!!!\n\nJoking again: You're going to miss having all those student loan payments to make in the next ten years.

I agree with you especially in regards to just taking the time to look for opportunities. \n\nAlso, its cool that you were so successful but still believe college should be provided for all.

Academically Suspended Student Lost on Next Steps,5,hmlpm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hmlpm3/academically_suspended_student_lost_on_next_steps/,1,"To make a long story short, I was in no way prepared for attending college after graduating from High school in May of 2018. I was in the process of recovering from previously being homeless, and I no longer had( and still don't have) contact with my parents. I only applied to one school and I was fortunate enough to be accepted. As soon as I graduated from high school I moved to the town where I would be attending college and began my first semester in the fall of 2018. At first, everything was fine, I quickly made friends and became involved, and for the first couple of weeks, I was doing decent academically as well. I was by no means on track to earning straight A's but I was on doing well enough to graduate on time. But as the weeks went by I got more and more lost, until I got completely overwhelmed, and I gave up. Although I knew that I was failing, I was too embarrassed to ask for help. I entered the spring semester with a low GPA and on academic probation.

Spring semester went a lot like the fall, I had a lot of momentum in the beginning, then got wrapped up, and gave up. On top of that, a close family member of mine died and as a result, my mental health declined rapidly. I was dismissed at the end of the Spring semester with a .213 GPA. I was advised to attend community college and send in a reinstatement letter at the end of my one-year suspension, but I decided to take the time off to figure myself out. 

In my time off I've learned that there were several reasons that I failed. I wasn't prepared for college, I didn't know what I wanted to major in, and I wasn't taking care of myself or my mental health. As previously stated I also applied to only one college and didn't do much research about others. I know that I want to major in business but I don't know what my next steps should be. I'm not completely fond of returning to the school that I previously attended because they don't have the best business school in my state (I'm located in Appalachia for reference) and I miss the city. I've been considering going to a community college for a year( or two? ) then transferring to a better school, but I don't know if my transcript at my first university that I attended would cancel out or diminish the new grades that I earn at a community college. Any advice or tips would be appreciated. Thank you.","[""Go to community college.

Has anyone ever gotten a student loan? I am in search of advice,1,hdhdhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hdhdhz/has_anyone_ever_gotten_a_student_loan_i_am_in/,4,"Hello! I'm 24F, SE USA.

This technical college is in my county, but it's about an hour drive on a tough day and 45 minutes on a good day. I am awaiting a monetary amount from FAFSA, but I want to also move out and live closer to school in my own space where I can practice my craft and be at peace (it's not the best household, and I have lived on my own before and prefer this.

Weird to email professor for advice about test anxiety?,6,gw9vll,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gw9vll/weird_to_email_professor_for_advice_about_test/,2,"The semester ended a couple of weeks ago, but I had a certain class that caused me extreme anxiety during tests. I think being online added to the anxiety. Anyway, I would become physically ill and almost pass out while taking my online exams and would do much more poorly than if I had not been panicking. 

After the second exam, my professor noticed my exam grades were unusually low compared to my other work in the class, so she emailed me and asked if something was wrong. I explained to her about my test anxiety and she offered me some tips to try to get it under control and told me she'd be open to talking more about it with me if I wanted. I was very touched that she cared and just thanked her while taking her tips into account.

On the last two exams I tried my best to apply her tips, but I just couldn't shake my anxiety. Again, I performed poorly compared to my actual capabilities.

This class has made me realize that I really need to start working on my mental health and get treatment and help from wherever and whoever I can. My anxiety is clearly getting increasingly worse with time and I can't let it go on like this anymore. So as my first step in trying to better my mental health, I was thinking about reaching out to this professor and asking her if she has any more tips for me, even if they're small. I wouldn't do this with just any professor, but she showed all of us in the class that she really cared about her students and their wellbeing, not just that they learned the class material. Also, as I mentioned before, she had told me she would be willing to talk to me more about my anxiety.

I'm just wondering if this would be weird since she's not my professor anymore? I really liked her and I think she liked me. She's a person who has a ton of life experience based on her background. I also might be taking another class with her in a couple of semesters.","['I don\'t think it\'s weird, especially if she was the first one to reach out to you when you were in her class.

I always struggle with self-doubt before exams, but I find that studying ahead of time by a week or so really gives me time to get the material down and I\'m able to trust myself more. That and just telling myself ""focus focus focus, you can do it"" during tests, sounds dumb I guess, but the internal dialogue helps me.']",6/4/20 8:06

The more money you put into it the more you feel like you have to commit I understand that. If you think college isn’t for you, at least right now, why go into more debt? \n\nAlso, it’s never too late to go back to college.

Advice for managing returning-to-class jitters?,320,eitwz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eitwz9/advice_for_managing_returningtoclass_jitters/,33,"Newbie to the sub here. I'm starting my third term in a little over a week and I am BEYOND stressed about it. For context, I am an animal science/biology major and I am working on core science classes that are required to take more specific classes. I completed my AA before going to a 4 year university so I don't really have room for filler classes to lighten my work load since I've pretty much taken all of them already. I did pretty good last semester academically, but my mental health took a turn for the worse and it made me just dread going to class every day.

So my issue is that I am having a real bad case of first day jitters even though this will be my third time starting classes. I am really dreading going back again and I really just cannot calm myself, just thinking about going back makes me nervous. I don't know how to cope since I wasn't nervous when I first started and I was completely fine going back the next semester, but now I'm literally freaking out.  I'm just looking for any tips I can get on how to cope and actually make it through going back without having a breakdown or something. Any help is greatly appreciated.","['It could be caused by being afraid of the unknown, and could cause the stress, and like you mentioned, a subsequent breakdown. What has helped me get past those things in the past is to make as much of your upcoming term known and tangible to you.\n\nGoing through the steps of planning and figuring out the things I’ll need to do regularly both academically and personally can help, and when you get to each day, you’ll already know what you need to do, and all you need to worry about in the moment is the little tasks you have created for that day. I find it makes it more accomplishable and focusing on short-sighted/daily goals helps in that effect.\n\nYou can also divide up large tasks/assignments/goals into smaller tasks, that when all of them are done, will accomplish the original goal. Then you can try and disassociate the smaller tasks from the original large tasks, so as to avoid the stress resulting from daunting assignments/studying/tests.  The smaller you can make the tasks, the better, as focusing on those will bring you farther away from the source of your stress.\n\nI hope this helps, and if your problem is different than what I have described or you’d like some elaboration, I’d be happy to provide as much more help as I can!', 'I can relate to this a lot. I get so anxious and worried about the upcoming semester right before it starts. I find that to help me ease some of my worries, I write down a lot of lists or charts that basically map out my entire day. I write down what classes I have each day, and plan out a checklist of what I need to prepare beforehand/bring to the class. I commute so I also plan out my sleeping schedule and what times I should get up, how long I can lay in bed for, when I have to leave, and how long it will take me to get to the school and find parking. This helps me keep myself focused on what needs to be done.', 'I actually dropped out my first semester because I have severe anxiety (long story, lots of therapy) and am returning this semester. And I am very anxious thinking about going back—so I feel you, I really do. The biggest thing that keeps me calm is to always think about the present instead of the past/future. Just go with the flow and don’t focus too much on what’s unknown to you or has already happened. I know it’s a lot easier said than done but it really helps me out having that mindset.', ""I had the same thing on my 2nd and 3rd semester, probably again once I return from summer break. It's a great learning opportunity to know what type of person you are. I look into class that sounds difficult and study in advance as well get a head start in the first week of orientation. It's easier for subject that are like math/science since the information doesn't usually change. Also take time after class to ask how to succeed in your proff class."", ""A couple of suggestions, one is to see the on campus counselor or a therapist in your area (I mention the on campus one first cause they are usually free). The next is to get a little paper and write down all your worries. What is giving you the jitters? The way the semester made you feel last time? The amount of work? How hard the classes are? Let it all out on to the paper. Then look and see what you can do about those things. If you're afraid of your mental health declining, see a counselor and look for things to bring in to your life that will better your mental state. If you're afraid of the work load, write out a written schedule and include study times and break times."", 'I got a different degree than you but can still relate to those Jitters.

Ed classes in community college. My best advice is plan everything. Get everything ready the night before, clothes, bag, set up your coffee/tea/water whatever you take. Make sure you know your schedule and where everything is, then take a hot shower put on a good show and relax. You'll be fine, you've done this before a million times. Set a bunch of alarms to when you need to wake up, when you need to get out of bed and when you need to get your ass out of the house don't be modest about it either 10 alarms just means you are 10 times more likely to get out on time. Also eat a good breakfast, bagels are a good one, they fill you up and are easy to make but premade breakfast sandwiches are always great to wake up too. When you finally get going with classes make sure you write everything down in a planner, set multiple due dates. Say you have a lab with corresponding paper have a date to be done with the planning, the lab, the outline, the draft, the final product and make time to do it.

Any tips for dealing with crappy professors?,666,dla6pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dla6pv/any_tips_for_dealing_with_crappy_professors/,61,"First day of class my professor assigns a controversial topic 5 paragraph essay. These are so easy I can do them in my sleep. She then goes on to have us brainstorm on the topic “reasons why people drop out of college.” People say things like “money issues, health issues, mental health, family problems, interest change, etc.” And she said “mental health isn’t a real thing so don’t ever write a paper about it, people who can’t afford college shouldn’t be in college, and family problems arent important at all, especially when it comes to your education.” So a brave soul stood up and asked “so you’re saying we cannot write about these reasons if we write about reasons students drop out?” And she laughed and said “I’ll throw it in the trash in front of you”

I go on to write my paper about whether or not college athletes should be paid. And tried to use graduate transfers as an example because they already have a degree and do not go to class.. she took my paper and threw it in the garbage in front of the class because I wrote something using another college’s football team as an example. (I go to a community college right now)

So is this normal behavior? Or should something be done about it? I just want some tips on how to deal with




UPDATE POST:


So I’m not too familiar with reddit yet so idk exactly how to make an update post, but I just went to the department head of liberal arts of my community college, she was busy (of course) and I was asked to wait. 10ish minutes go by and I asked her receptionist if I can run to the bathroom. I get up to go and find there’s a doctorate professor with open office hours; so I go and ask her specifically about my paper (which I had to pick up out of the trash) and ask her what exactly was “wrong”. She looks through it and says “well looks like your professor said you didn’t do MLA correctly” (I’ve been doing MLA papers since 5th grade and my comp 1 prof said I was excellent at MLA formatting). Paper was double spaced, TNR with 12 pt font. 1 inch margins, etc. She assumes I’m upset with the professor because “you got a bad grade. They won’t switch you because you don’t have a valid reason.” So im already a little pissed off because I have to deal with my professor and now the higher level professors are telling me I can’t switch either. 

I go on to argue with her and try and plead my case and still she says no. Again not even her decision if I can switch, that’s the department head’s job. Then I bring up “well my professor said mental health isn’t a real thing and personally I’ve got bad anxiety and have been working through it. So how can I deal with my anxiety when I have a professor who thinks it’s all a joke?” And IMMEDIATELY she turns around what she’s saying and says “let me get you in with the dean right now and fill out the student issues form” 

So I’m still waiting for the dean and will update this post again whenever I’m done! 

Again sorry if it’s sloppy or hard to find, I’m still new to reddit and don’t know a lot!




UPDATE 2: 

Dean dodged my meeting and told me to schedule another one with her receptionist. The receptionist heard 1/2 of my argument and had to stop herself from saying anything negative about the professor. “If it’s a controversial topic essay, it should be written about a topic that’s controversial to the student, not based on what the professor wants to read right?” Is what she asked me and I said “finally someone who gets it!!” And so I’m scheduled to meet with her tomorrow 11:30am. Will update again. 

My goal is solely to get out of this class and hopefully get into a better comp class. I will post my review of her on RMP so hopefully people can avoid her at my college.","[""What the hell?

Don’t be afraid to ask for extensions,14,g0uv81,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g0uv81/dont_be_afraid_to_ask_for_extensions/,4,"Just some advice to anyone else with time management issues, poor mental health, or anything else that may cause you to wind up scrambling at the last minute to turn in your assignments.

I get it, you procrastinated and/or convinced yourself you’d have enough time and now you’re suddenly panic-writing an essay as if your life depended on it. Most of us don’t like telling our profs that we’ve messed up, because it can be embarrassing to admit. If you’re anything like me, you avoid communicating with profs at all about your shortcomings because that conversation is super intimidating.

But ultimately profs aren’t super concerned about their students being perfect - they’re here to teach and help us get degrees, and from my experience they prefer when a student reaches out for help rather than them failing.

Profs are being especially generous now during the pandemic, but I realized even before that profs tend to be much more laid back about extensions than most of us students realize. I’ve asked for extensions plenty of times in university, and I’ve never once had a prof deny one. If you bother to ask politely, it seems that most profs don’t mind giving an extra day to complete something. It’s a lot better than turning in something late, and dealing with a late penalty - giving a heads up that you won’t finish something on time is rewarded more than getting it in late with no prior communication.

Even if your profs aren’t the types to grant extensions, it *really* doesn’t hurt to ask. One time I was almost in tears trying to finish a 20 page research paper worth most of my grade. I sent an email asking for an extra day to finish (citing my mental health at the time, which was bad), and my prof gave me a whole week and wished me well. I ended up getting an A, and was able to go to sleep early that night and focus on taking care of myself.

Tip: if you’re asking for an extension, suggest a reasonable timeline. Let them know you’ve made progress, something got in the way, and you will be able to get it in within the next day. Don’t ask for an extra week to finish something - that’s ridiculous, unfair to other students and could put your prof behind on their grading. Usually I just ask if I can submit something the next morning (if it’s due at midnight). Generally they give me more time than I ask for anyways, but you never want to come across entitled or unreasonable asking for a little grace.","[""I'm pretty sure most professors understand at this point the coronavirus may hinder some of their students from being able to submit assignments."", 'this was before the coronavirus, i was in a mental funk and wasn\'t ready for a midterm so i emailed the professor ""hey i was going through a funk and i\'m not ready for the exam. i was wondering if i can take the test after the spring break, maybe with points deduction. but i understand if you can\'t make an exception for me.

Preparing for the Coronavirus as a dorm resident,9,fjtav0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fjtav0/preparing_for_the_coronavirus_as_a_dorm_resident/,10,"Hi guys,

So as a dorm resident I'm finding prepping for the potential need for quarantine tough. Here's an overview:

\- I'll have the dorm to myself. I will definitely be staying here for the next 3-4 months.

\- I'm frequently wiping anything I handle often -- door handles, my phone, my keyboard -- with wipes.

\- I don't have a fridge or freezer in my dorm, nor a water boiler. Our residence hall has a microwave in the first floor.

\- Dining halls will be open but I want to decrease interactions for health concerns. I'm also preparing for in case I get sick and need to be quarantined.

\- There' s a water fountain in my floor.

\- I have cleaning alcohol, wipes, hygiene supplies (hand soap, shampoo, etc.), paracetamol, cough drops, and a stock of oranges.

\- Entertainment will not be an issue.

I'm preparing to go shopping, but I honestly don't know what to buy other than a ton of snacks (Cheetos, Oreo, chocolate, etc.) and canned food. I can't even cook the stuff we're advised to buy, like pasta or beans. Do you guys have any tips or advice for me? It can be foods I can buy that can be prepared / stored in my situation, or things I haven't thought of buying. Please help me out, I feel like things could get worse here at any moment.

Just make sure to put in enough water and stir it so it mixes all the way through, and also watch it carefully because it boils over easily. \n\nYou could also get some cans of soup if they have them. Some bags of nuts in general might be good to keep your protein up. \n\nIf you’re buying ramen, maybe consider getting some add ons, like dried mushrooms, soy sauce, or sesame oil, that you can get to add in extra calories. All of these items are shelf stable.\n\nEdit- also worthwhile to fill up on any toiletries you might need in the next month (shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc). If you’re washing your hands a lot, consider getting some lotion too so your skin doesn’t crack from all the washing. Laundry detergent also.\n\nEdit 2- crackers and things to put on them is also good!! Here’s things to put on crackers- honey, peanut butter, tuna, spray/canned cheese (kinda slaps tbh), jerky. Also you might wanna get some cough syrup/DayQuil/NyQuil if you get sick, as well as some Gatorade powder. If you get the large canister of powder, it will last you way longer and you can make more Gatorade than if you got it premixed. Gummy vitamins would also be worth buying if they have them in the store.', ""I'm a homeless student, they made exceptions for my people to stay on campus.""]",3/17/20 1:58
How do I prepare myself for 4 months of immense mental and physical pressure and exertion and no Saturdays off,35,ekzp2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ekzp2o/how_do_i_prepare_myself_for_4_months_of_immense/,9,"I'm in an  academy (my college doesn't teach that well) the academy (evening classes of a private institution) is like mandatory IF you want good grades so we have this 'test session' where they take tests and exams EVERY single day to prepare us for the actual 'final exams' held on provincial levels. Even Saturdays aren't off. I've been doing this for years tho this is the last year. I used to be very passionate about it and have always scored good grades but I'm just so fed up and burnt out now. 

At this point, I'm so exhausted and tired. I feel stuck and have no sense of progress. I am opting for an arts university. These are science subjects. I feel like I should be practicing art?? But then these grades are important because my family is putting alot of money and effort into it. I don't want to sound like a spoiled brat but I know it's gonna be so depressing. It is every year. Very stressful, hard, exhausting, depressing, lonely. I'm dreading having to start.

Everytime I skip a test (due to health issues or a break) I feel immense guilt. There is not a single day where I can relax. These 4 months seem like HELL. I've already skipped 3 tests because of 103°F fever. I know the teachers will give me shit like ""you weren't dying were you? You should've come!""

I know there's no way out of this. I have to do this. But how do I prepare myself for this mountain of stress coming at me? I get sick easily when I'm stressed so I usually have to skip tests because of this. The cycle goes on.

Everything you learn and experience can contribute to your creation of art and because it\'s your perspective and experience with it, your art will be unique.

Whether it\'s writing in a journal, sketching , or playing a song with more feeling, doing art in response to these stressors will help you in the end.\n\nIn the end you have to ask yourself whether your goals and dreams are worth what you\'re going through now. Ask yourself what you\'re willing to do to obtain the things you want and if you\'re only giving lip service to those dreams. For example, if I want to be a billionaire but I\'m not willing to put up with the stress, time, and money to get there then being a billionaire wasn\'t really a dream of mine.

I've always been a good student who's taken pride in learning and putting in effort to truly understanding subjects, something which has paid off as I've earned decent grades. However this semester, it feels like I've lost the motivation, passion, and **discipline** to put any effort to doing my schoolwork - even if they are subjects that I feel interest me.

I'm already halfway to the semester and I've already missed a few major assignments (two short essays worth 10% of the grade and a production assignment) and I've failed to keep up with 50% of my readings, and I've missed a few of my classes. Every time I try to start on my assignments or readings -  I feel this strong sense of de-motivation and anxiety. Even when by some miracle when I *do* start my assignments I take 2x as long as normal because I keep getting distracted or feel the need to have every single detail to be *perfect.* Or I feel like all my energy is spent on stupid thins like work and chores instead of those important things.

I don't know how to confront my Professors about this. I feel embarrassed to be another student who doesn't put any effort into their classes. I genuinely wanted to do better this semester, and I feel like I ruined potential relationships with professors for future internship references. I don't expect them to make special accommodations for me as this wouldn't be fair to others - but I wish I could explain to them what's going on and ask them for some tips to improve.

# So I guess my question is how can I actually push myself to finish this last half of the semester to do my readings, essays, and assignments?

I had a horrible transition from high school to here because of some serious drama that had me depressed till now, and more.  the only cool thing about this school is that it is in a major city

The obvious answer would be to transfer. Right? I mean, if someone hates a school, usually they do transfer. But, I cant make my mind up. I dont want to make an immature decision because Im just a dumb freshman or something. I also go to a somewhat prestigious school, and the schools I would transfer too arent as prestigious I think. People back home, especially my parents,  think its SO cool that i go here. Its just so stressful. I dont want to make my parents sad because I want to go to a lesser ranked college.

I think my mental health would improve a lot more too with sports and school spirit and more people so i could reset my college experience. 

Idk, i cant figure it out. My mind is all over the place and I dont wanna make the wrong decision and regret transferring or not transferring at all.

Sophomore Slump,1,esuwfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/esuwfa/sophomore_slump/,2,"TL;DR I have $7,500 in debt, a 3.1 GPA, and poor mental health, and the commingling of the three cause me great stress and anxiety. (See bottom of post for questions).

     To get a gist of where I am with my education, I’m a sophomore and transfer student to a state college where I study English literature and history. I have a 3.1 GPA, and I’m en route to graduate a year early; I’m looking to attend graduate school to obtain a master’s degree in English. 
     I’m not sure what it was about winter break, but it took the piss out of me. I’ve worried extensively about paying off my $7,500 of debt. (I require a $2,500/year loan to pay my tuition). I also feel like I’m not smart enough to be a college student; before I transferred colleges, I had a 3.7 GPA, but the stress of clubs, academics, and finances have largely played into my preexisting poor mental health. While I’m reminded frequently that a 3.1 is nothing to be ashamed of, I’m perfectly aware that I can to better.
     With my exposition aside, I was wondering how many people worry about these things too. While I know that I am not alone in feeling how I do, many people in my life who are similar in age to me seem to have everything together. Is paying debt as tumultuous as it seems? Do academics really affect one’s post-college life? If so, what are some tips for breaking the sophomore slump and getting the grades I’d like? How common are these feelings of great stress and anxiety?","['Hey! Mom of 2 homeschooled kids and full time college student here. I tend to beat myself up about my grades too- I’m a bit of a perfectionist. I currently have a 3.29 GPA. I am told repeatedly by my teachers that a 3.29 is still something to be proud of! In order to not have anxiety about it all- juggling many things- home life and school.. I just do the best I can and try to be proud of myself for trying! That is the only thing I can control! Me. My study habits. My knowledge. It’s ok to get a B. It’s ok to make mistakes. It’s ok to bomb something. It’s also ok to slow down! You don’t have to take the recommended units. Bet you would see your grades improve! I take 12 units every semester because that’s what I can handle! I also understand the worry of getting into debt. Apply for scholarships for the following years.', ""I don't worry about the debt part (for context I expect similar to your $7,500), I worry much more about a good entry into the field and good career growth because this has more long-term meaning than a small student loan. These two things would determine how quickly you would pay yours, so it makes more sense to stress about these than the actual loan. $7,500 is not a large loan though: I'd say most students can shoot to pay that off in 6-12 months, but it depends heavily on a lot of individual factors.\n\nThe debt is much more stressing if you don't have a reasonable plan and goals through and up until after college. People may tell you that your major isn't worthwhile but that's not true provided you have a reasonable plan. I don't think any major isn't worthwhile *if* the person has a reasonable plan to get a job and earn the money (or lifestyle) they intended to have when they signed up for it. I do think that certain majors are much harder to make and execute good plans for and that certain majors have a lot of people without plans. You might want to consider working hard to make a specific plan, it will probably help reduce your stress if you don't have one. By specific, I would probably mean for the next 3-4 years with a timeline, SMART goals, your salary goal, etc. Have you tried making something like this before?

Tips for surviving the spring semester (especially if you’re graduating this semester or the upcoming year),3,ern0ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ern0ly/tips_for_surviving_the_spring_semester_especially/,1,"-Pay attention to deadlines

Please, please, please know when is the last day to withdrawal from your class before it’s too late and you’ve been charged for it permanently or get a W on transcript (which is not bad, though you would only want to save it as a last resort)

-Find a good study group 

Study groups can help make or break you for example I took a law class that I got a D on the first exam, but I hooked up with an amazing study group and ended the class with an A+.

-Find a good support group

Can be your friends, family, professors, academic advisor, or even the school therapist if your school offers one for free or at an affordable range. It’s important to take care of your mental health as well as have someone you can trust talk you through your worries.

-Take advantage of YouTube and learn some new study tips or affordable meals

At the point I’m sure we’re all a bit addicted to YouTube, but it’s not just for fun lol. Find some new ways to study or explore new options on meal preparing that can help you save money.

In addition finding a ""realistic"" college YouTuber can help to give you enthusiasm on days you feel down or just to have a study buddy lol.

-Don’t procrastinate

This is like a major tip that I also have a hard time struggling with lol but honestly if you know you’re a procrastinator try and start things off early. For example if I have a paper due at the end of the month I’ll start it that first two weeks then come back to it the week it is due to finish up. So in a way you’re procrastinating but you’re an effective process 

And lastly just remember you guys hustle and kicked ass to get you how where you are today. And if you’re not proud of what your last semester was it’s okay. You have another chance and hey if you mess up there’s going to be another chance. Just remember to take care of yourself because you’re doing amazing sweetie 😭💕

Dealing with Burnout in College: My Story,70,boro14,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/boro14/dealing_with_burnout_in_college_my_story/,12,"Have you ever felt de-motivated, lethargic or like you couldn’t bring yourself to care about anything? If you’re like me then you’ve probably felt this way before but was unsure as to why. Today I am going to share with you my personal experience overcoming burnout in college and how you can use my strategies to ensure you maintain proper physical and mental health in your own academic journey. Now here’s my story…

My animated summary: https://youtu.be/MvD2kV-pTw0

It was a Friday night in March and I had survived another grueling week of intense studying and exams in my masters in accounting program. Whereas I was usually full of energy on a Friday night, I found myself rather lethargic, not having much of an appetite which for me was rather unusual. As most Fridays in university went, my phone was exploding with messages to come party and not wanting to be the odd man out I got myself together and met up with my friends. As I was at the bar, I started to feel even more tired and told my friends I had to sit down. My friends returned to the dancefloor and as they returned to check up on me they found me passed out on the floor. I woke up the next morning but instead of being in my bed I was at the hospital with one of my best friends by my side. He filled me in on what had happened and the only thing I could think of was that I had to get home to study! As the doctor came into the room, she explained to me that my body was overworked and that I needed to take better care of myself to avoid this happening again. My prognosis was simple: burnout.
 
As I laid there in the hospital bed, I knew I never wanted to go through that horrific experience again but I didn’t know how to change my lifestyle to avoid burning out again. I felt like I always had so much to do and that I couldn’t afford to take anything out of my busy schedule. But if I didn’t I was destined to end up back in the hospital or worse…

I spent the next week at home recovering from this traumatic event when my friend Justin came to visit. Justin was a great student and an awesome friend and he always amazed me as to how he could manage juggling so many of his life responsibilities like school, work and exercise. I then asked Justin, “You do more than me how do you avoid burning out?”. What he told me changed the course of my academic career and my health forever…

Justin began to explain that building good study habits is one of ways he avoids burning out. He explained that there are two types of students: the effective and non-effective studiers. The effective studiers allocate a couple hours to their notes and focus without distractions. The non-effective studiers set no time restrictions on their review but allow themselves to work with Facebook open, music playing and their phone by their side. Sadly, the second scenario resonated with me. Justin said that he used the time he saved to relax, go out with friends and be social all while obtaining some of the top marks in our program. This tip alone blew my mind so I pleaded to Justin to share some more of his secrets.

Justin went on to explain that he used to constantly double book his commitments causing him to stress out which I knew that I too found myself guilty of doing. He then pulled out his IPhone and showed me how he now tracks all of his classes, work shifts and social outings on his Google Calendar. Hearing this suggestion, I began to kick myself as I was wasting time on useless apps like Facebook and Instagram when I should have been using apps to organize my schedule and ultimately help avoid the burnout that I fell victim to. 

Seeing his busy schedule on his Google Calendar, I had to ask, “Do you ever sleep?”. He laughed and told me that sleep is critical to his academic success and avoiding burnout. Justin highlighted how so many students in college like to brag about how many all-nighters they pull each semester but in his research, sleep was not to be neglected. Not surprisingly, he cited one study that showed that students, like Justin, who obtain the best marks sleep 8 or more hours per night. Admittedly, getting more sleep made sense but if you’re like me then wanting to get more sleep and actually getting more sleep can be challenging so I inquired how Justin ensured he regularly got eight plus hours of sleep.

He responded with one word: No. I was confused at first but then Justin explained to me that saying no is the key to protecting the time he needs to study, exercise and sleep. In college, it can be easy to get wrapped up in all the parties and extracurricular events. However, these events can easily begin to detract from your ability to focus on the activities that are the most important to academic success and health. Justin explained that whenever he is asked to take part in any activity that interferes with his pre-planned study, exercise or sleep commitments in his calendar then he automatically turns them down in order to preserve the time he needs to maintain his health and mental well-being. Right at this point in his explanation, Justin’s phone sounded and he was off to the gym.

Fast forward two months and I was back in exam time, the same period that a few months prior had sent me to the hospital. Luckily, this time I was prepared. I had all my study periods blocked off in my calendar, I studied without distractions and ensured that I slept as much as I could. That exam period, I wrote four challenging exams and to my delight, I scored in the top 10% of my class on all of them! But better yet, I had zero trips to the hospital which I can thank my friend Justin for!

Hope this can help other students going through exams!!!!","['[deleted]', ""This is going to sound counter-intuitive but part of the reason why I took an 18 credit semester despite everyone telling me not to was because I wanted to experience what taking upper-class courses from my major would be like (I am a second semester freshman). I was petrified of taking 4 advanced courses in one semester. So I did it and I got exactly what I asked for. My terrible study habits weren't going to pass me this time. Its like I knew it in the back of my head that the only way I would change my habits would be to have my ass kicked and get that traumatic first-hand experience.  I didn't realize till later in the semester that I really couldn't handle it. I had to use Pass/No credit a 4 credit lecture and I'm barely putting up with calc II. I didn't want to do any work and hated studying.\n\nA few weeks ago I tried to study for my last in-class calc exam by breaking time throughout the day dedicated to studying rather than cramming everything at once and lo and behold, I scored a 103. Not only was it the most difficult chapter (series for those of you wondering) but I now had the tangible evidence to support something I never believed would ever work for me. Went from scoring low 70s to 103 just by splitting up time. I am glad I put myself through this early in the game before it would've been too late."", 'Great advice!', ""Great advice!

I have kinda been dealing with some depression stemming from the fact that I am in community college going on year 3. I also started my first serious relationship in a long time, which I hate to admit, I think it took my mind off the game. This semester I took Calc II, Physics 195 (mechanics) with lab, and chem 201 (gen chem 2) with lab. I started with the mindset that this was going to be a very hard semester, which did not help my motivation and determination. I did okay on the first round of exams (except physics), but then I did very very poorly on a calc II exam. I was extremely upset with myself and knew I could have done better but didn't study effectively. This threw me for a loop. Second round of exams came up and I did horribly on physics again, so I had to make the call to drop the class in hopes that it would allow me time to do very well in my other classes. Well.... I did horribly on a chem exam and today I basically failed our last calc II exam before the final. I am extremely down, I feel horrible, and I feel like I really fucked up and wasted an entire semester (which is ironic because this will keep me at community longer, the thing that bothers me most).

My guide to a 4.0,632,7mm5ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7mm5ol/my_guide_to_a_40/,80,"**Background:**

I graduated somewhat recently in physics and applied maths with a cumulative GPA of 4.00. I've seen a lot of posts here on r/college over the last few years of people freaking out over their grades and/or looking for advice on how to do well, and maybe some of what I've learnt could help others. Obviously, this stuff is aimed towards STEM since that's all I really know, but general tips map over to the humanities. These tips are in no particular order, just whatever comes into my head. Most are probably (very) obvious, and it's long. I've also TA'd for numerous classes, so if you have more specific questions r.e. maths or physics study or heading into grad for either, I can answer in comments or PM. This is certainly not an exclusive list, it's just a general one.

tldr: 

 - Go to class

 - Pay attention in class

 - Do the work

 - Put effort into the work

 - Plan ahead

 - Read the goddamn syllabus

 - Get help early

 - If you need accommodations, get them

 - Be nice to the professor

 - Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc

 - Study to the tests/exams

 - Don't say you'll do better ""next time""

 - Know how you learn best

 - Have your priorities straight

 - Be prepared to let it all go


--------

**Go to class**.

It shouldn't need to be said, but there it is. Even if the class is boring as all hell and you think you already know it all, go anyway. Some classes take attendance, some give pop-quizzes, some offer extra material not available online or in any recordings/notes, but it's just a good idea to be present regardless. Our brains form associations really quickly, so you'll learn better in the lecture hall that you always learn in rather than sitting at the desk you regularly play computer games at. You'll also be able to ask for clarification in real time, which no recording or personal study will ever afford you. Plus, it gets you in the professors good books, or at least helps keep you out of the bad books. That's incredibly important. 

**Pay attention in class**.

Once you're there, you need to actually listen. No browsing on your phone, no checking twitter on your laptop, no chatting with your neighbours, and no work from other classes. You should be paying such ardent attention that you are exhausted at the end of a 1-hour lecture. You will undoubtedly fail occasionally, but you need to force yourself to refocus every time. Do whatever you have to in order to keep paying attention. For me, that meant always taking notes by hand even if notes were printed and handed out to us by the professor before class. I never revised by my own notes, but it was important to take them anyway. The more effort you put in to learning it the first time around, the less work you need to do outside of class.

**Do the work**.

Again, should be pretty clear why, but this is the biggest reason why people fail IME. It's actually really *hard* to fail a class if you give every assignment a proper try and hand them all in on time. Even if you know you've left it way too late and can't possibly get it completed, a half-assed 50% is magnitudes better than a 0%. 

**Put effort into the work**.

Never hand in any piece of assessment as ""good enough"". Your final-copy 5-page assignment in maths should originally be a 20-page draft when you include your additional derivations and long-working. Don't skip steps: it doesn't make you look smarter, it just makes mistakes easier. I will happily expand out factors term by term if it avoids a mistake. Do your work neatly and follow standards in setup/layout. Chicken-scratch ramblings don't get a prize; the less pleasant your work is to mark, the less lenient markers will be. Remember that there is a human marking your work, so intersperse the maths with some words explaining what you're doing and why. You can still be awarded marks for correct reasoning even if you make a foolish mathematical error somewhere. This also applies to exams and tests: if you make a mistake somewhere but can't find it or don't have time to fix it, make a note of it on the paper. If you really run out of time, list the steps you *would* have taken. That'll get you something too. Also do sanity checks on your results: you've probably made a mistake if the ball is travelling faster than c.

**Plan ahead**. 

Life is shitty, and shitty things happen unexpectedly. Maybe your car breaks down, maybe your neighbours keep you up with loud music all night, maybe your dog is sick, maybe your computer fails spectacularly, maybe the power gets cut off, and maybe you just plain forget something. Have reasonable contingencies for these sorts of events. Leave a little earlier to account for any delays in travel, finish your work a day or two earlier, keep backups in multiple places, email yourself copies of important documents, set copious alarms, and have some kind of planner. Know when difficult weeks are coming up and start things earlier than usual to reduce workload later on. Being organised is probably the *most important* thing you can do to ensure success. Your memory and ability to react quickly and reasonably to complex situations is really not that great, so craft these safety nets ahead of time. It's enough to simply have a plan that you are aware of. Fix problems *before* they are problems. 

**Read the goddamn syllabus**.

Don't get caught out by participation marks after you've already missed half of the lectures. Know how much different sections are worth and roughly when they are due (some due dates may change). Be aware of minimum requirements, especially for lab classes. All of my classes had rules that you had to get >45% in all of the lab, homework, and exam portions in order to pass the class. If you got 70% overall but 40% in the lab portion, too bad - you fail. A syllabus is not a legally binding contract, but they are quite important nonetheless. Also, **keep the syllabus**. Partly in case you need to dispute something, but also, in some situations when transferring credits, universities will ask for the syllabus from your classes to judge equivalency. They are usually required to be from the correct semester/year as well IME, so no sneakily grabbing a newer one.

**Get help early**.

If you struggle to understand something in week 1, get help for it in week 1. Not week 2 and not week 13, *week 1*. Your problem with the content doesn't go away once the class moves on, it just starts festering under the surface and jeopardising everything you learn past that point. This also applies to mental health or other extreme personal circumstances. Professors and administrators can do a lot to help you early on in semester with medical withdrawals and the like, but they can't do much at all to help past a certain point. Don't look at asking for help as ""begging"", but rather as taking agency over your own learning and your own life, and recognising when you need more information/support to work at your best. You cannot control what happens to you, but you *can* control how you deal with it. 

**If you need accommodations, get them**.

If you know you have ADHD or are prone to mental illness like Depression, get the required documentation and get accommodations from your university. It isn't some dick-measuring contest to see how long you can go without your meds and there's no gold star for foregoing all treatment. University life is *tough* for a lot of people. If you try to go it alone and fail, *you* are the one who suffers from that sort of hubris. I had accommodations for issues with concentration and processing speed. My internals and labs were great, but my early tests were consistently 20% lower; having accommodations simply levelled the playing field and made my grades more regular. Real life is not like an exam and you do not need to sit under the same conditions. If you need an extra 30 minutes or a quiet room to work in, get it. Having these accommodations can also help with requests for extensions or leniency in marking if you suddenly fall ill. It certainly saved my ass a few times. 

**Be nice to the professor**.

(Assuming they're a reasonable human being, of course) In many classes, the professor has a lot of power. They set the rules of their class and they are also free to bend those rules as they see fit. If the professor likes you, they may give you an extension when you're stressed out or simply forget homework, will invest more time and energy into your learning, offer you extra opportunities in their field, act as great letter writers later on, and simply be a great addition to your network. Many of the things I achieved during undergrad came from my contacts with professors, who then pointed me towards friends with good opportunities in national labs and prestigious universities. The person with the personal contact wins every time. 

**Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc**.

Professors are actually kinda clueless when it comes to the running of the department, but the local head administrator knows all. Befriend the person who's actually in charge and you'll never be stuck in endless loops of administration bullshit ever again. Hiring opportunities inside *and* outside of the department flow through this person first, as do many applications afterwards. Forms you need to fill out will pass this point as well, and they are often the ones with a tight hold on the money-strings. They also know their equivalent in other departments, and can get you priority meetings/appointments. They are typically well-known and very well-liked, and their seal of approval on you carries weight. 

**Study to the tests/exams**.

Don't do 100 problems out of a dusty textbook your professor has never used as the format and method of solution will be slightly different. When you're first learning something, using multiple distinct methods can throw you off and you gain nothing from the exercise. Look at previous exams if available through your library to get a feel for the general format, as questions tend to be similar over the years. If these are not available, then use previous questions set to you or other questions from the same pool. Study strategically to match. 

**Don't say you'll do better ""next time""**.

So many of my friends would get 60% in an assignment, brush it off immediately, and say they'd just make up for it next week. They never did. Assume your grades will *decline* over the course of the semester as you become stressed and burnt out, so put effort in early. If you get a poor mark, organise to discuss your mistakes with the professor ASAP. For the next assignment, ask to have it checked a day or two *before* you submit it. Professors and TAs are usually more than happy to review drafts of substantial work before submission, you just need to ask and be willing to hear criticism. It is not an attack on your character, they are literally just telling you what you need to do to earn a higher grade by the rubric they have. 

**Know how you learn best**.

If you do your best work between 7pm-9pm, then save tough things for that time. If you find it hard to get up and pay attention in 8am classes, try to avoid signing up for classes at that time. If you know which professors teach to the style you like to learn in, take their section if available and suitable. But always be reassessing these methods. If the evidence of your results isn't backing up your statements, you need to figure out what's going wrong and fix it ASAP. Keep your fingers on the pulse at all times and be ready to adapt. 

**Have your priorities straight**.

Know how important your grades are to you from the beginning and stick to that. After a terrible run in high school, I decided that I wouldn't settle for any kind of mediocrity and whenever I lost focus, I reminded myself of that goal. Don't say that you want top grades and then act completely opposite to that statement. But don't go too far the other way either: if you get to the end of your degree and have nothing but a 4.0, then you've wasted a lot of your time. You need to have experience in your field and other things going for you. Know what is important/necessary and what is not for your specific goals and living situation. If you need a supermarket job to pay the bills, keep it. If you really don't need the money, find something more constructive and relevant to do with your time. 

**Be prepared to let it all go**.

Getting ""good"" grades is a matter of effort, planning, and natural aptitude in some measure. Graduating with a 4.0 specifically is pure luck. Even a headache on the day of an important exam can send things down the drain, and no matter how well you plan ahead, random events *will* affect you. I failed in plenty of the above tips over the last 3 years. I skipped out on weeks of classes because I thought I knew everything, I didn't plan ahead properly and had horrible all-nighters, I tried to get through without disability accommodations, I allowed myself to get so ill as to not hand in assignments, and I crammed for exams. Blind luck and the curve pulled me through every time, but it could easily not have. Finishing with a 4.0 is nice, getting that sweet medal is cool, but it means next to nothing the day after grades are released. After you land that first position, it really won't mean anything at all. Keep the achievement in perspective and don't lose sight of the things that really matter at this point in your life, whatever that point is. But if you want that 4.0 just as a personal goal and keep sight of everything else, don't let people dissuade you from it or convince you that you should care less. If you want to set the bar high, make sure it's feasible but then hold yourself to it. ","[""Additional note; getting great grades isn't as important as having a great understanding of the material. Usually they're the same but not always. Make sure you grasp the subtleties and nuances of your studies."", 'This makes me so happy to know that people succeed in the Major that I dropped since the first day.', ""Great post! I would add: get enough sleep! People tell me that they can survive on 4 hours of sleep a night but their grades would disagree. If someone does pull a 4.0 sleeping 2-4 hours a night, they are the exception and not the rule, and more sleep doesn't hurt.\n\nAlso, try to create a daily or weekly routine or schedule. For example, if you have four classes, devote 1-2 hours each day per class, or if you have specific recurring tasks like lab write-ups or problem sets to complete, schedule them for particular time-slots on particular days. This is called time-blocking your tasks. When you develop this routine it makes it easier to stick to it rather than blow it off or procrastinate. And in many cases you can create it so that you regularly finish your important work far ahead of the deadlines so you rarely feel rushed to finish work.\n\nFind your work space. Your workspace is simply the place that you are objectively the most productive. NOT the place where you THINK you will be the most productive. Measure how much work you get done at various places, and choose the place where you accomplish the most as the place to go when you need to finish work. For me, that is a coffee shop. For others it might be the library. It rarely is at home where you have your TV, video games, and bed softly calling to you while you try to concentrate."", ""Wait, I don't see blackmail or sleeping with your prof on here? What kind of list is this anyway?"", '>Go to class.\n\nA thousand times this. It\'s so simple, but people fall in the trap of being lazy and skipping.

Show up.', ""Great post OP. I would add a section on maintaining one's physical/mental health. It's Equality important when it comes to doing well in college. Thank you! "", ""Sometimes it doesn't matter how hard you try. My school grades on a curve, 6/50 students received a 4.0 in my computer science class between two sections.

It comes down to the connections you make NOW.

The College Guide for Poor Kids,84,95pppu,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/95pppu/the_college_guide_for_poor_kids/,47,"hi r/college!

After browsing this thread for a while and also just searching online, I realized that while there’s an abundant amount of information and college survival tips/guides for the average college student, there’s hardly any for *actual* poor students and students of immigrants/first gen kids. After three frustrating years at Boston University, a seemingly progressive private institution that basically just discriminates against its lower income students, I decided to create my own guide as a lower income student who is a child of a single parent immigrant for anyone who might be facing the same experiences or about to enter college. Feel more than free to enter your own tips and/or experiences! 

1. Work Study: Most lower income students qualify for work study, and while its a good federal aid opportunity, I quickly realized after my freshman year that you don’t really get paid enough to live because there’s a cap on the amount of hours you can work, especially if your parents can’t afford to give you some spending money too. I recommend getting a second job if possible, and either working very little hours through work study, or forfeiting it altogether. 
2. Financial aid: You’d think schools would be more willing to help lower income students who are already enrolled but that’s just not the case. If you ever find yourself needing more money from the school, I highly recommend appealing for more (even if its a small amount). If they deny your appeal, keep calling the office. I have a friend who even emailed our financial aid office once and talked about his deteriorating mental health as a way to guilt trip them into giving more aid. 
3. Discrimination: The funny thing about my school (and probably all seemingly “progressive” institutions) is that they try to hide how discriminatory they are. This year, and every year for the past three years, I was “randomly” selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you’re only targeting low income students. Little things like this are the just some points of discrimination I and many others face every year at private institutions. 
4. Health Insurance: If like mine, your parents are immigrants and don’t qualify for health insurance, the odds are that your school will try to force you to pay for their student insurance plan. That would be fine, if said insurance plans didn’t cost thousands of dollars, which is kind of contradictory if you can’t afford health insurance, or tuition, to begin with. I didn’t realize until this year that there’s an easy loophole around this if you’re able to find a part or full time job that offers health insurance, which is helpful to begin with if you already plan on getting a job in addition or in lieu of work study. 
5. Housing: I lived in on campus housing for the first two years of college, and then decided to move off campus. Many other low income students I know fear doing the same because of student housing scholarships, which is fair, but what I’ve found is that living off campus is for the most part still cheaper than living on campus with a housing scholarship. If you also get federal aid, that money can also be refunded back to you to pay for the cost of rent. At the end of the day, paying around the same to live off campus and have your own room, kitchen, privacy etc will always be better than living on campus and sharing a room with someone in a dorm that hasn’t been renovated in 50 years. 
6. Friends/Socializing: This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with, because I’m constantly surrounded by middle class and to upper class kids who complain about how poor they are and how expensive school is. Yes, school totally is expensive. But I can’t pity someone who comes from a well off family when mine can barely afford rent let alone put me through school. (Seriously, I once had a girl complain to me about how her family makes 100K so she doesnt get any federal aid and so “in a lot of ways college is harder for middle class students than poor ones”). Its also hard when your friends parents pay for all their ubers and they can afford to go out almost every day and you can’t. My best advice is to not try to follow that lifestyle if/when you can’t. It sucks, but unless you want to work like a dog to be able to afford it, it really isn’t worth it. 
7. Parents: If you’re a first gen college student, especially if your parents arent from this country, there’s a weird phenomena that happens in college where you kind of feel caught between worlds. There’s the world of poverty you feel like you belong to, and then there’s the world of academia and security that you’re introduced to. In a way its alienating, because you can’t really even turn to your parents for guidance since they haven’t experienced it. You can’t ask your parents about motifs in *The Great Gatsby* if they’ve never read *The Great Gatsby*. This is actually still something I struggle with, but the longer I’ve been in school, the more I’ve been able to find people in a similar boat. We’re all sinking together. 
8. Major: This is similar to the above. There’s a huge pressure, once again especially if you’re the child of immigrants, to study something lucrative in college so you can make more money and rectify their choices/emigration. That’s perfect if you naturally excel and want to study engineering, but it can lead to so much anxiety if you want to study something related to the arts or humanities. My best advice is to study what *you* like and what makes you happy even if your parents don’t approve, because at the end of the day its your life. Additionally, it can still be difficult to pursue the arts in school because, at least in my experience, most kids who do study something in the arts are the ones who can afford to, meaning they have their parents to fall back on and pay their rent even if they dont excel after college. Or, their parents have the ability to help them out after school with industry connections. 
9. Student Organizations: One thing I’ve found after joining a fraternity is that dues are super high and you can’t always afford them even if you’re working. This is even harder if you can’t ask your parents for financial help, so apply for all the inter-organization scholarships you can, or try to talk to the leader of whatever organization you’re apart of about lowering your dues.
10. Textbooks: Split the cost with a friend! Check the university library because they often have a copy of whatever book you need! Then photocopy the book or ask to borrow a copy from your classmate and then photocopy theirs! Yeah its time consuming, but textbooks are super expensive and this is a virtually free way to get them. I haven’t had to encounter any online textbooks that *require*  you to buy them, but I would also talk to the professor of whatever course you’re taking and explain the situation. They’re a lot more understanding than the university as a whole.
11. Food: Ask your friends who have meal plans to swipe you in! Buy in bulk! Trader Joe’s is cheap and incredible! I also recommend buying groceries every two or three days instead of weekly to avoid waste of food and money. 
12. Mental Health: Even today its still kinda taboo to discuss mental health, and i felt weird mentioning that i go to therapy until this year when i realized a lot of my other friends do too. don’t hesitate to go, even though i know how hard it is to take the first step. More often than not, whatever insurance you’re on covers most or all of your outpatient costs, and if its still too expensive, most universities offer on campus licensed mental health professionals at little to no cost. One of the perks of being in a high stress environment. 

That’s all for now but I will definitely update if i think of anything else. Apologies if any of this comes off as bitter or spiteful towards anyone who isn’t from a low income/international fam, I love everyone regardless but it can definitely be isolating to only see middle class and upper class experiences discussed in both this thread and around you at school. Feel free to add below !! ","[""For food: learn to love rice. It's pennies a meal compared to ramen. Beans are cheap protein."", 'Verification be like ""haha no one could survive on that little money!""\n\nSource: have been chosen for verification every single semester', '👌🏼👌🏼 been trying to figure out a way to word how my experience @ college has been and this sums it up to a T! it’s real out here. props to you for making it 3 years in - lots of my first gen friends have been dropping like flies. it’s important to remember that being first gen / low income shouldn’t be a shame or a burden, but an honor. we made it to these colleges with half of what our wealthy peers had & are still thriving despite all the obstacles. & no one will be able to take that degree away from us after we graduate. ', 'Thank you so much! As a first-gen, low income student, I find all of the tips relatable and downright realistic!

But (before you baselessly hurl accusations at your school for being hypocrites), you should probably know that *your school isn't the one selecting you for verification*.  The entity responsible for that would be the Federal Student Aid program administered by the U.S. Dept of Ed.  u/nesland300 does a good job of explaining why the results of their screening aren't truly random.\n\nI'm not saying it's fair; I'm saying know who to be pissed at."", '> This year, and every year for the past three years, I was “randomly” selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you’re only targeting low income students. \n\nThe Department of Education uses a risk-based model to select FAFSAs for verification. Verification is meant to check for errors and fraud. High and low-income FAFSAs can both be prone to errors, but high-income FAFSAs are a much lower risk for fraud (because it doesn\'t benefit you to fake a high income). That leads to higher-income FAFSAs being selected less because the higher the reported income is, the more ""self-checked"" they already are against fraud.', 'I’ve never taken work study because I can work more and make more at a part time job. Also, some colleges have free or cheap walk in clinics as an alternative to health insurance. Obviously if you fall deathly ill or break your leg, you’re screwed. But sometimes if you get a sinus infection or strep, you can walk in, get diagnosed, and get antibiotics for like $20', '1) I agree with your take on FWS. I\'m starting a Writing Center job this month, and the way I see it, the aid that comes from it is supplementary to cover weekly costs and little else.\n\n2) So agree with this! I appealed my financial aid package due to the high loan to total aid ratio, and Fin. Aid simultaneously reduced my loan amount and added on FWS. It may take multiple emails or calls, but persistence and documentation are key.\n\n3) Verification really isn\'t as ""random"" as colleges claim it to be. I\'ve been selected both years I\'ve applied for the FAFSA, and one of the ways to reduce your chances of being selected is by having your parents\' information sent via the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. The problem? They don\'t have an account, and even if they did, the IRS has stated that the DRT isn\'t working until further notice. Because of that, I have to retrieve extra documents and wait longer than I would otherwise. Meanwhile, many of my more well-off friends don\'t experience this.\n\n7) I can relate to this one. Even though my mom has gone to college, there\'s still a persistent struggle balancing cultures, so to speak, between home and uni. The best thing I\'ve found to help with this is meeting others who can relate to this kind of experience.\n\n10) In addition to your great points, I\'d suggest finding downloadable copies of textbooks through trackers or something similar to further reduce textbook expenses. Avoiding access code costs are a different problem altogether...\n\nAs you mentioned, there are plenty of people on Reddit who post about their experiences and advice that aren\'t as relevant or feasible for students like us. However, I do think many lower-income students post around here without necessarily identifying themselves as such. That\'s not to discount your point or anything, because posts like these are refreshing and needed. Thanks for the insightful post, OP!', '[deleted]', 'Ugh I had almost forgotten about being chosen for verification. You’re completely right with the discrimination based aspect of it.

Didn’t even know verification was a thing. \n\nThey verify the people they’re giving the most money to, simple as that.

Sorry in advance for the long post. I recently graduated from high school and am headed to college in the fall, so I picked up what I thought would be a relatively easy, stress-free summer job to make some extra cash. 

The job is very overwhelming and it's difficult for me to juggle what the manager is expecting of me. Basically, it's an indoor kids playground with a restaurant area, so I need to monitor everything going on, help people purchase admission, and take food orders as well as cook all the food (crappy microwave kid food but it's still pretty complicated since I need to memorize 20+ recipes as well as smoothies, coffee drinks, etc). Usually there are supposed to be two people working, but it's sometimes only me. On my second day of work she had me open by myself and I had to handle the entire shift alone. My manager has said that I'm the employee with the most potential so she trusts me with all of this, but truthfully I feel overwhelmed and dread going in every day. That said, it may just be extra stressful since a lot is being thrown at me at once. Things may improve once I get a little more comfortable in the role.

Usually I would just tough it out, but this is my last summer at home with my family as I'm moving 6 hours away for college and I want to be able to enjoy it. I don't necessarily need the money as it's only 11/hr plus tips, but it is my first official work experience (had unpaid internships before). The job and stress is really impacting my mental health and I'm constantly thinking about it even when I'm not working. I also wanted to relax this summer as the college I'm attending this fall is notoriously hard. 

If I don't quit within the next couple weeks (I'm technically still supposed to be training for the next two weeks), another option is to just quit at the middle-end of July when my family goes on vacation. Then at least I'll have a few free weeks with my family before college.

What are my options? I feel shitty because they've already invested a significant amount of time into training me, and my manager has said I have a ton of potential at this job, but I don't want to be this depressed during my last summer with my family. Thanks.

tldr: overwhelmed at summer job, don't necessarily need the cash. wanted to relax and enjoy this last summer with my family but instead I'm stressed and depressed. what should I do?","[""Yup get out.  Take care of yourself, don't stress over a job that won't care about you."", '>My manager has said that I’m the employee with the most potential\n\nMy man, I’ve worked enough to know that your manager is trying to instill some BS morale in you when in reality she doesn’t even care about you.

That money you are earning (no matter how much it is) is worthless if your happiness is being sacrificed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, don't feel bad about simply walking out the door and saying bye.

Has anybody taken 7 classes in a semester?

Just make sure to take breaks when you can as well, and if you are struggling with your mental health I highly recommend going to your colleges counseling services regularly if they have them. Also practice self care, the real kind where you sleep properly, eat healthy, exercise, drink water, etc., not the bath bomb and ice cream kind.', ""Well, the average number of classes in Europe is 6 (at least in my and quite a few other countries). 7 is above average but certainly isn't considered that hard.

I had about 10 first semester, 9 second semester, and 8 third semester (while the final semester was entirely a placement). It was rough, especially going from high school where I had 4 classes a semester - hell, 2 classes in my final semester (I did a fifth year) - but time management plays an important role, it's all about regulating your time.\n\nYou just have to schedule yourself everything that you need to do. You'll have your class schedule, so you go over it and see what your free time is during the day, both before, between, and after classes. You work in the best times to study and do your homework and try to keep to those schedules.

I'm 26 and finished community college and am now transferring. The entire time I was working full time. I had a couple semesters where I was a full time student well. The trick really isn't a trick. You need to make a schedule and set timeslots for when you're doing your class work. I normally did my work in the evenings. \n\nNow for me (personally), online classes were the easiest. Some people really struggle with the online aspect. The pro was that I didn't have to waste my time commuting over to the college and could better allocate that to working on actual homework. \n\nLastly, if you aren't getting aid, you can take just a couple classes at a time to get a feel and see how you can handle it. Once you see how it fits into your life and schedule, you can add in more classes."", 'This is really doable! I’m also an older student, and we tend to really give our all to our studies because we value education differently from an 18 year old freshman. I’m envious of your crazy low mortgage and also excited you want to get back into school. You’ll be a more fulfilled person after going for it! \nBusy schedules, IMHO, seem to make a person work harder than if they had an excess of free time. Because you only have narrow time slots in your week to complete homework and exam prep, it can force you to stay focused and motivated. Having something to identify with other than academia really helps a semester pass smoothly too. You’re just in “work” mode with no chance to escape, and sometimes that’s a good thing. On the flip side, when you’re only going to school without anywhere else to be but a lecture, sometimes it’s easy to get lazy and comfortable.\nI think taking a hard look at what each week would be like is important. Explore what classes are available, see how rigorous and demanding they tend to be, and start off slow with 1 class or so. It’s all about good study habits and a great support network.\nSetting aside time every few weeks to just unwind and energize in whatever way you wish is gonna prevent burnout! How flexible is your work/boss? Could you call off to prep for an exam? Do you get called in to work at inconvenient times? Establish those boundaries between school and work so you can fully maintain both worlds.\nSide note: You might even have a school compensation program at your job. Hope so!

Community College Over UC?,1,c6pvt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c6pvt2/community_college_over_uc/,3,"HELP LMAO, I’m an incoming freshman who got accepted into majority of her top schools (including UCI & UCLA)  as a psych major. I was INITIALLY planning to attend UCI for the upcoming 2019 fall semester but I’ve been going through a bunch of issues since the beginning of this year that has definitely impacted my situation. I was hospitalized in March and am now going through recovery from treatment center to treatment center and my doctor has suggested I request a deferral for my admission and just go in for January 2020, or take a whole gap year. 

My whole high school career I feared no college would accept me. I wanted to attend UCI so badly and have had my doubts and stigmas related to community college. 

I submitted by SIR to UCI but I missed the deadline for housing, for the SPOP orientations, etc etc etc. I feel like a complete mess and to add onto that I haven’t received any financial aid because my parents make too much. And I have to pay for further education by myself. 

I’m thinking of completely ditching the idea of going straight into a 4 year and attending a CC (possible Orange Coast College?) and transferring over to UCI, or another UC/CSU? For now I think I’m pretty set on majoring in psychology. But I really need help on trying to figure out what to even do and how to enroll for the January 2020 semester? 
I’m taking a gap semester to recover my mental health and dedicating this time to my recovery, knowing I probably would not do as well as I know I could probably do without my illnesses. 

Please, any help, any tips, anything is appreciated. I feel like I’m falling through so many holes and I’m willing to bounce back. 

TLDR - HOW DO I TRANSFER FROM A CC TO A UC WITHIN 2 YEARS AND ENROLL FOR THE JAN 2020 SEM AS A PSYCH MAJOR ?

Transferring is not an easy process although assist.org does make things easier I guess. The transfer process has its ups and downs.

"Need advice - Balancing job, school, and mental health",4,aqlww6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/aqlww6/need_advice_balancing_job_school_and_mental_health/,6,"Hi everyone, I need some advice. A little background first- I’m planning to graduate December 2019 with a bachelors in art history. I have job hopped around all during my college career, trying to find things I could handle that also worked with my schedule. I have a difficult history with my mental health (depression, self harm, eating disorder, and anxiety) so part of this is trying to find a balance. 

I am taking 4 art history courses and 1 studio art course - this includes my senior seminar and writing intensive classes. I also work as an assistant manager at a studio locally, about 3 days a week, sometimes 4. I can manage class and work, but doing research and studying outside of class is impossible for me. I’m supposed to do original research for three of my classes but I don’t even have time to do regular studying. 

Any tips on how to balance this out and maintain my mental health? Or am I just taking on too much? My parents said they’d help me out if I quit my job because school comes first, but I can’t help feeling like a slacker and weak somehow if I quit. ","['You might be taking on too much, but your professors may be able to work with you. My university had an office for students with disabilities--I got a referral there from the counseling center for anxiety. I was able to be given extensions on certain assignments due to anxiety caused by how much I had to do (full time student, working 30 hrs/week, maintaining high GPA). If your GPA is good, the school is likely going to respect that you are not faking it or trying to take advantage of the system\'s benefits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also take the time to make an appointment with each professor individually. Explain how much you work and the high expectations you have for your grades. It is possible that they will give you more notice of assignments in advance. For example, I had a professor go over the next month\'s assignments very generally and say ""this week, there will be a lot more busy work, so you might want to plan accordingly"". I would also go constantly for feedback and help. Even if you can do it all on your own--you\'d be surprised what tests and hints and suggestions from the professor can cut down the total time needed to study. I had one class that I struggled in (discrete math, lol) and went to the professor every week. I worked during her office hours, so she came in at 7am once a week just to help me succeed. I would ask specific questions and show her the steps I was confused about in the assignments. At the end of the semester I had an 86 (B+) but she bumped be straight up to an A. I also had a professor that was very caring and we got to know each other on a personal level, and when I had a personal emergency I was able to email her and she let me turn in an assignment late... if they know you respect the class, they will be more lenient as they trust you are not taking advantage. You really never know what could happen, but having a good relationship with your professors can make the process SO much easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, I would plan your classes better in advance. Before the registration window opens, and before advising, look at the possible courses. Make your own (tentative) schedule, don\'t wait on your advisor. Look up those professors on ratemyprofessor, ask peers if they\'ve had them before. You can even go to their office and talk to them. Figure out which classes are going to be hard, easy, and which ones are going to have a lot of busy work. You may not be biting off too much, you may have just selected a semester where there is too much busy work course material, making them hard when taken together. It can make a huge different to take easy classes in the same semester as the busiest classes, even if it means taking things out of order. Talk to these concerns during advising, and your advisor may be able to provide input as well. I found that keeping a high GPA made advisors more likely to approve taking things out of order. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it helps lend credibility to my advice, I graduated in 5 years with a BA in Graphic Design and a BS in computer science and two minors (I had 214 credit hours), working 20-30 hours a week all 5 years, and graduated with a 3.94 GPA.

My team is great (HR), my executive is great, this company is amazing, but I don't want to be a career admin and I know that I need a Bachelor's degree if I want to advance at all in any field in any company. I started working full time out of high school, and with no support from anyone, and college fell to the wayside so that I was able to pay my rent and other bills, etc.

&#x200B;

Now that I'm a lot more stable, I'd love to go to college and finally get my degree. Since I am full time, I'm looking at a 100% online education, if possible. I'm currently enrolled at the CC closest to me, and I *could* go to classes after work if I wanted to, but I know I'd perform better at home than sitting in LA traffic for over an hour each way to/from the school and getting home at 12am every other night. I'm enrolled in this CC with the intention of transferring to a University to get a Bachelor's. I'm currently trying to get my gen ed out of the way, but I did sign up for one Anthro class that looked fun so I'm not bored out of my mind with school work. :)

&#x200B;

Here's my predicament: I'm so torn with picking my career path. I have quite a few interests, but they're either deemed as ""useless"" degrees or difficult to pursue online.

I have a few ideas of what I would love to have as a future career, and they are:

* Creative Marketing
* Brand Management
* Art/Creative Director
* Consumer Insights
* Visual Communications
* At one point I even wanted to be an athletic wear designer! (which I'm still interested in tbh)

Those would obviously require some type of creative/design degree, which I'm struggling with because that's really difficult to do online from the colleges I've found so far (if it's even offered at all). I've heard that for-profit colleges are looked down upon, and that's pretty much the only thing I've seen that offers something in that realm. I've mentally accepted the fact that I'll be taking out student loans, but I'd love for them to not be unbearably high from a private institution if I can help it.

&#x200B;

If art/design isn't something I could do online, I'm also interested in majoring in:

* Cultural or Linguistic Anthropology
* Psychology

However, I've heard those degrees are pretty ""useless"" and it's hard to find a job that pertains to them. I think they could be useful if I decide to stick with the HR team I support and turn that into my career path, but I'm not sure if that's for me. Could they work for the careers I've listed above?

&#x200B;

In the end, my dream is a career that allows me some creativity, independence and autonomy (but allows allows for some collab work occasionally), feels fulfilling, pays well (by LA standards), and allows for some potential to transfer internationally or travel. I'd be interested in working for a company that is in entertainment, travel, fashion/athletic apparel, music, animals, or health/wellness. My dream companies are Outdoor Voices, Nike, Adidas, entertainment/film studios/companies, Expedia, Kayak, Marvel, etc.

&#x200B;

**Any advice or tips ?** I've been researching this for weeks to no avail and I'm starting to get overwhelmed to the point of just picking something I might not care about just to make the class enrollment deadline. Any majors or careers that sound like they could suit my interests or fit the fields I'm looking at? I'd be happy to provide more info about me if that helps.

**I'm also wondering if what your degree is in really matters?** I hear conflicting information, so I'm not sure. For example, if I wanted to work in Creative Marketing or Brand Management, would it even matter if I had an Anthro degree?

Additionally, medical, engineering, and computer science degrees are not of any interest to me.

Will I Be A Bad College Student?,4,83da8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/83da8o/will_i_be_a_bad_college_student/,16,"Howdy,

I’m in a senior in HS right now with a gpa of 2.5 so I know I’ll have to transfer from community to four year. I’m kinda scared of what College has in stall for me. 

I did really bad in high school because of mental health and because I’m not very good with homework although on tests I usually score A’s or high B’s so I know it not because I don’t understand the material. I guess it’s because I find it hard to focus on anything that’s not mentally stimulating enough (which is why I love tests so much). 

Recently (senior year) I’ve been getting better with the homework part since I got a job and was put in an environment where I couldn’t just ignore work ethic. I also figured out I find it hard to focus on anymore than four courses; I have the habit of obsessing about one course and then forgetting the others.

Trust me, a bit every day for each class builds overtime and is likely the one habit that has kept me sane during tests.\n\n4) rewrite your notes as you slowly go through them.

Unusual ways to finally start to get enough sleep (v2),7,95lyxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/95lyxr/unusual_ways_to_finally_start_to_get_enough_sleep/,3,"This is a redefined version of the post https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/8mtaef/advice_unusual_ways_to_finally_start_to_get/

>   **-Wilson Mizener**

&nbsp;

I struggled with getting enough sleep for many and many years. I felt tired and
sleepy all the time. I woke up every day exhausted. Get up from the bad was
extremely difficult. Every day I had to fight fiercely to leave my lovely and
comfortable bed.

&nbsp;

**I’ve always known sleep is extremely important.**

&nbsp;

“To promote optimal health and well-being, adults aged 18-60 years are
recommended to sleep at least 7 hours each night (1). Sleeping \<7 hours per
night is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood
pressure, coronary heart disease, stroke, frequent mental distress, and
all-cause mortality (2-4). Insufficient sleep impairs cognitive performance,
which can increase the likelihood of motor vehicle and other transportation
accidents, industrial accidents, medical errors, and loss of work productivity
that could affect the wider community” 
Yong Liu1, Anne G Wheaton, Daniel P Chapman, Timothy J Cunningham, Hua Lu, Janet B Croft, 
MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report [^1]

&nbsp;

I started to have better results in college only after I started to sleep
properly. **I thought was better to sleep less and have more hours to study.** I
didn't know the brain works also when I am asleep.

&nbsp;

“Picture the peaceful sleeper nestled under the covers: body at rest, breathing
and pulse slow and steady. But beneath that serene surface, the brain is hard at
work, processing the events of the day. It sorts and files, makes connections,
and even solves problems.” [^2] (health.harvard.edu)

&nbsp;

“Eight hours of sleep makes a big difference for me, and I try hard to make that
a priority,""(Jeff Bezos ,Thrive Global[^3] )

&nbsp;

“I’m more alert and I think more clearly. I just feel so much better all day
long if I’ve had eight hours.”(Jeff Bezos ,[Wall Street

""I like to get seven hours of sleep a night because that's what I need to stay
sharp and creative and upbeat."" (Bill Gates, Microsoft FAQ[^5])

&nbsp;

**What about the people that can sleep only 4-5 hours a day?**

&nbsp;

“Trump's doctor says he only sleeps 4-5 hours each night”
(businessinsider.com)[^6]

&nbsp;

I have always envied these people. I wanted to be like them. I loved the idea of
having more hours available. I was using them as an excuse to sleep less. After
years I have understood that my reality is different. I need more hours to get
fully rested. Living out of fact was only making my results worse.

&nbsp;

**Accepted I’m not one of them, how can I start to sleep better?**

&nbsp;

When I had problems sleeping, I look for the answer on google. It appeared a lot
of articles with almost the same content[^7]

&nbsp;

\- sleep 7 hours or much

\- go to bed and wake up at the same hour

\- do sport

\- No phones, pc, tv, ... before bed

\- etc

&nbsp;

Some doubts start to rise.

&nbsp;

**About sleeping routine.**

&nbsp;

How can I sleep 8 hours, go to bed and wake up at the same hour, if I need to go
to uni early and go to bed late while having a bit of social life?

The only solution comes out in my mind is to hang out with my grandma and her
friends.

&nbsp;

**About sport.**

&nbsp;

What sport?

Running? Boring

Gym? Boring

Football? Bad at it

Soccer? Basketball? Worse than football

&nbsp;

An excuse pops up for every sport.

But also if there is a sport that I enjoy, who has the time?

&nbsp;

**About electronic devices**

&nbsp;

If I lay down in bed without anything to do, my mind starts to think about any
possible problems in my life, anxiety increase and I can’t sleep. I need
something that let me don’t think about my problems to fall asleep.

&nbsp;

**A possible solution**

&nbsp;

There are a lot of variables that influence sleep. Influencing these variables,
you will influence your emotions, and so your actions in the long term. Your
actions will influence your results.

&nbsp;

“It is important to realize that emotions guide almost all our actions and
decisions in life.” (Karin Roelof, *Professor - *[Behavioural Science
Institute](http://www.ru.nl/personen/?org_range=Afd&org_id=100004)*,* [Radboud
Universiteit](https://www.ru.nl/personen/?org_range=Afd&org_id=100002))[^8]

&nbsp;

Today I have a sleep routine that is close to what articles are usually saying.
But it would have been impossible starting from there. So I will give you
another option, backed by science.

&nbsp;

Think of this as a starting point, like a snowball that is beginning to get down
from the mountain. You don't have to influence all variables now; you can
gradually alter them. It will be much easier than doing all at once. And without
realizing it, the snowball will start to become faster and faster.

&nbsp;

**1. set the alarm to stop studying**

&nbsp;

I realized I need time to come back home, eat and have some rest time. This time
is almost impossible to compress. So if I put an alarm that said to stop
studying, then I can have the time for doing what I need to feel good.

If I don't do this, I will eat dinner late, go to bed late and wake up late.

&nbsp;

**2. put an alarm when going to bed**

&nbsp;

I set this alarm to remember then when it rings everything has to be stopped. I
set this alarm 15 minutes before the target time because usually, I need to
finish what I'm doing.

&nbsp;

*Point 1 and 2 are functional to the first step “Stick to a consistent sleep
schedule and routine”* [^9]

&nbsp;

**3. don't watch series or make any addictive things in bed.** (sex excluded )

&nbsp;

I often watch a series before going to bed, but not in bed! I make a warm milk
after the series to contrast the bad feeling. I drink it in bed, and it makes me
relaxed. (health.harvard.edu)[^10]

&nbsp;

**4. How to stop your mind from thinking, and feel relaxed?**

&nbsp;

I use documentaries. I look for one I like, but that is not too interesting.
Usually, they are free from problems and gives me the possibility to think about
nature, which is relaxing for the brain.

&nbsp;

Nature Documentaries And Being Outdoors May Provide Similar Mental Health
Benefits, Study Says (medicaldaily.com )[^11]

&nbsp;

Remember to use night mode like those provided by Flux or Windows 10.

&nbsp;

**5. Put an automatic stop timer to stop the documentaries.**

&nbsp;

Usually, I find 36 minutes perfectly to get asleep with the documentaries but
without realizing that it finishes.

&nbsp;

If I don't' put this stop timer, I will wake up later in the night and I will
difficult to sleep again.

&nbsp;

What if after an hour you are still awake?
This simple guide can’t help you. Look for another solution or consider to talk
with a specialist.

&nbsp;

**6. Get up late**

&nbsp;

“Find more energy, not more time” Connor Swenson, from the Partnerships team at
Google for Entrepreneurs.” (thenextweb.com)[^12]

&nbsp;

Do you think is better to work 5 hours with a relaxed mind or work 7 with an
exhausted mind?

&nbsp;

“Making a small number of key decisions well is more important than making a
large number of decisions. If you shortchange your sleep, you might get a couple
of extra 'productive' hours, but that productivity might be an illusion."" (Jeff
Bezos, cnbc.com)[^13]

&nbsp;

If you don't have enough time to get your mind relaxed and to study enough,
there is a problem with your weekly plan.

Here’s a great guide to create a weekly plan

<https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/weekly-plan/>

&nbsp;

**Warning**! If you have lessons in the morning be aware of this:

&nbsp;

Going to the teaching entirely exhausted will be useless but, not going to the
lesson and then not studying day by day will be worse than going to the lesson
exhausted. Why? You will probably delay the study of this lesson. In the end,
you will be near to the exam date without even know what the subject talks
about. And as you may know, it is not a good situation.

&nbsp;

Do this only if you know that you will study day by day the subject. It is
useful to use notes of your friends or use professor videos. To increase the
probability of study this subject consistently, do it as the first thing.

Flunking my first semester of college; need advice,6,a02rj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a02rj5/flunking_my_first_semester_of_college_need_advice/,1,"Before anything, I need to say that this was completely my fault. I don't have any mental, or physical health problems. My family is supportive and stable. I didn't even have a part-time gig to worry about. I was just plain lazy, and thought I could breeze through and still make one of the top of my class, just like high school...

&#x200B;

And look where that's gotten me? Failing most of my classes, financial aid probably being cut off, and with nowhere near enough to pay for the next semester to redeem myself. I'm thinking about just telling my parents, and sheepishly working for like a year or two before... I don't know. Another go at school, I guess. If anyone has any tips, i'm all ears. ","['First you have to forgive yourself. I know you said it was your own doing but you’re never gonna move forward until you just accept that you fucked up. Next, try to make an appointment with your counselor. They will let you know where you’re at, what classes you’ll have to retake, what classes you should take instead next semester, what your schedule should look like. A lot of times first semester students schedule their classes poorly and don’t realize that they aren’t maximizing their time. Lastly, you have to learn from this. You have to make a promise to yourself that you will do better. I knew a lot of people my first semester of college that did the same thing, one of my friends almost lost his scholarship, but he turned it around by reaching out to his counselor and really committing to his education.

Ten Essential Tips for College Students,95,3l9nol,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3l9nol/ten_essential_tips_for_college_students/,38,"I've been in college for four years now. In the past four years, I've made my fair share of mistakes, discoveries, and just little tricks that make the whole experience infinitely easier. I figured that I'd post a few of these for everyone's perusal, and hopefully it will help someone out! While I may not post all ten right away, they will be up within the day.

1.) **Textbooks**

*The bane of every poor college student's existence, textbooks are a money vacuum - plain and simple. However, there are so many ways to mitigate the excessive cost of your textbooks.*

*First, while I would never advocate pirating textbooks, I will say that you'd be surprised what a textbook name or author's last name will turn up on the popular torrenting sites. They may be an older edition, but the changes between two editions are usually minimal.*

*Second, your university library is likely to have copies of some textbooks available. If you are the early bird, you may just get the worm in this instance (The worm is the textbooks).*

*Third, you will always find a cheaper place to buy books online. Amazon or various book rental sites will sell them at a fraction of the cost. Online PDF copies of a book are far cheaper than their physical counterparts. For classes that require an access code, always check the website for how much directly buying the code would cost - sometimes these programs come with an ebook included, or will provide an eBook far cheaper than the physical book with the access code.*

*Fourth, if you are willing to take a small risk, and have trustworthy friends in the class, go in half for the book. There's no shame in sharing a textbook, especially when it saves you money.*

*http://gen.lib.rus.ec/ may also help you in your search for textbooks or general knowledge!*

2.) **Professor Picking**

*If your college allows for you to register your own classes, you will often find that the same class is offered by multiple professors. You have resources available to you that are invaluable to this choice. Ratemyprofessor.com will give you a general idea of what the professors are like (if you can wade through the reviews of disgruntled students). Asking around in your major, particularly the older students, is another great way to get some insight into the various professors, their teaching styles, the workload, and how willing they are to work with you. Taking the time to research the 'optimal' instructors will save you a fair amount of aggravation. Every college has 'horror story professors' and you can avoid them if you try, usually.*

3.) **Office Hours**

*Most, if not all, students never visit their professors during office hours. This is a mistake. Aside from earning a few brownie points that you can hopefully use in the event of missing an assignment, professors are happy to help you if you're struggling with the class. For those of you that don't require any help, still go! Professors have spent years networking, and may just be your ticket to an internship or co-op.*

4.) **Keep your old classwork!**

*I have an entire external drive devoted to all my classwork that I've ever done, with folders dedicated to each class. There are often times where your courses subjects may overlap, and you may find answers to current problems hidden amongst previously completed work. Use an online free cloud storage like Dropbox.com or Google Drive to store your work, both old and recent.*

5.) **Find a healthy stress-reliever**

*College may be one of the most stress-inducing times in your life. Without an outlet to release some of this pent-up stress, your health will suffer, and subsequently so will everything you're involved in. Find something you can dedicate an hour every other day to, and do it. For me, it was boxing. Three times a week, I'd go to a gym nearby, and just spend 30 minutes or so unloading my frustrations onto a punching bag. Give something similar a try, whether it be jogging, a martial art, weightlifting, swimming, anything! It will keep you physically healthy, as well as mentally healthy.*

6.) **Procrastination and You**

*If you are anything like me, your biggest enemy will be yourself. Namely, your penchant to procrastinate on assignments until the day they're due. I'm guilty of it, I'm sure most college students are. Heck, I'm procrastinating on an assignment as we speak by writing this post. I'm sure you've heard the spiel about proper time management at some point or another, so I won't even bother. I'll tell you what actually works.*

*Take your books/laptop, only what is absolutely necessary to do your homework, to a quiet location. The library is the obvious choice, but maybe you have somewhere better. Set small goals for yourself, rather than a large one. Stay in the library for 1-3 hours, and tell yourself what you are going to do in that timeframe, and do it. Without your phone or other people to distract you, your productivity will skyrocket. It's far easier to say ""I'll do a page of this essay in the next hour"" than ""I need to do ten pages by Thursday."" Do not allow yourself on social media during this time.*

*I encourage you to make a small investment in a dry-erase board - preferably one with a calendar. It lets you write down everything you have due, the due dates, and it's immensely more satisfying to wipe them off this board as you finish than deleting them from a smartphone list. At least I think so. If your assignments aren't submission-time-restrictive (having to turn something in on a specific day, and no sooner), then as you write your assignments down, shift the due dates back a few days. You'll finish earlier, and it gives you a less wiggle room to procrastinate. If you're like I was freshman year, you'll try finishing (and starting) a paper the night it's due. This way, when you enter panic mode, you'll realize that you aren't as strapped for time as you thought.*

*All in all, procrastination can only be solved by you and your willpower. Removing temptations from the equation, and putting yourself in the proper mindset will help you emerge victorious, but it still boils down to that key battle.*

7.) **Making Friends!**

*I've always found that since I've been in college, my friends have always fallen into one of two categories: academic friends, and activity friends. Sometimes these overlap, but it's the exception and not the rule. The former can help keep you on track, provide a study buddy or a textbook trader/sharer, and (if they're older) give you advice about the major you both have. The latter will keep you sane, and make sure that college doesn't completely send you up the wall.*

*Your college or university will probably have more clubs than you could imagine. These clubs are a great way of meeting other students with similar hobbies, beliefs, and interests. If you're a political person, join the Young Democrats or Young Republicans. If you enjoy gaming, I almost guarantee there is a club associated with video games. Devote some of your free time to attending a few club meetings, and see if you make some new friends!*

*On the other side of the coin, you should try to make a few friends that share the same major as you. These will be the people that you will probably see in the same classes you're taking for the next four-five years. It could be as easy as introducing yourself to the people sitting next to you in class or making friends during a group project. Your major probably has a club or group associated it, and this can be another good place to meet people. These friends will be godsends if you miss a day of class and need notes, need a helpful reminder when something is due, or give you a groupmate that you know.*

*If you feel like making friends with neighbors in your dormitory, try leaving your door open some! You'll be associating with these people in some capacity for at least a semester. If they walk by and see you playing a videogame, you may find a player 2.*

8.) **Your GPA and Scholarships**
 
*I cannot stress this tip enough. If you are a college student and receive almost any type of financial aid - whether it be state/federal grants, scholarships, anything - there is most likely a GPA requirement. Using myself as an example, my scholarship requires I maintain a minimum 3.5 GPA to continue receiving it. It is vital that you find out what these requirements are, memorize them, and understand what that means in terms of your expected academic success.*

*While it is sometimes possible to appeal to the Financial Aid Office if you do not meet these requirements one semester, it's better to avoid the situation all together.*

*So what can you do to salvage, save, or maintain your GPA?*

*Give yourself some ""easy A"" classes. They may not count towards your program. They may not help you meet your upper-level course requirement. They might not even teach you anything. But if your entire college career rides on you maintaining a specific GPA and getting that financial aid, having a small cushion can help. They may cause you to be a bit behind schedule for graduating (most people are anyways, these days), but for institutional scholarships I have found that requesting an extension is far easier than appealing for it to be returned.*

*If it is relatively early in the semester and you find yourself utterly failing a course (sometimes you miss/fail one exam, and that's all it takes. It happens.) look into your university or college's policy on dropping courses. Pertinent information to know is the deadline to do so, the cost of withdrawing from a course, as well as if a ""Withdrawal"" counts against your GPA. You shouldn't do this often, but it is better to withdraw while you can than to ride a rough course until it is too late, and end up with a E, F, U, or even a D in some cases. These grades will not give you 'credit', but will utterly sink your GPA. Be realistic and honest with yourself if you see this happening, and act decisively.*

*To show an example from my personal history, I had managed near-straight A's throughout my first two semesters of college. Due  to a professor's strict attendance policy, I failed one course during that second semester. Fifteen hours each semester, with one E, one B, and eight A's, my end GPA was a 3.5 - nearly losing my scholarship . Do not underestimate how much a bad grade can affect you.*

*In more extreme cases where an entire semester went wrong, you may have the option to declare Academic Bankruptcy. It's a fairly complicated process, and you should really only consider it in the most dire of circumstances (you failed literally everything, or almost did). It basically invalidates a whole semester of your college work. It will not count against (or for) your GPA, you will not receive credit for the classes you passed, and a note will be made on your official transcript noting that you have done so. It's a double-edged sword, so be cautious.*

**For the last two cases, remember to discuss these options with your academic advisor or financial aid advisor, to ensure that there are no complications or hidden drawbacks.**

9.) **Citations (AKA Satan Incarnate)**

*It may just be me, but I've hated citations since the first essay I had to write in college. APA, MLA, in-text and 'Works Cited'/'Bibliography' pages, they can be infuriating, confusing, time-consuming, and grade-determining. Fortunately for the citation-inept among us, we have the joyous internet and its many resources.*

http://www.easybib.com/ *and* http://www.bibme.org/ *are sites designed for one main purpose - to create your citations for you. Website data can be automatically retrieved for the most part, and you may need to manually enter it in for some other media, but these will provide you with the proper format and even help you make the page itself.*

10.) **The Other Tidbits**

*For things not extensive enough to write a lot about.*

* *Wear flip-flops in the public/community bathrooms. During showers, especially. The germs...eugh.*
* *Your campus most likely has a health clinic. Use this. From counselling services, to STD testing, and everything in-between. Never be embarrassed to go, for any reason. They are professionals, and doctor-patient confidentiality is a thing.*
* *Give online classes a chance, especially if you find yourself struggling to attend the face-to-face classes.*
* *Learn how to do the FAFSA yourself, if you need it.*
* *Meal plans may be a requirement for your school. They are generally not cost-effective, and mostly encourage unhealthy eating. Reducing your meal plan or eliminating it gives you a chance to learn how to budget your own food, how to cook, and may just save you a fair bit of dough (ha, ha)*
* *Online classes + PDF textbooks can be an...interesting...combination when it comes time to take quizzes or do homework. If your morals are slightly malleable, CTRL + F on the book and keywords from the questions might just help your GPA.*
* *Seriously, invest in a dry-erase board.*
* *Sync your school email to your phone/tablet/everything. Last-minute updates can happen, and let's be honest...you will check it more this way.*
* *Backup all your important class files. Twice. Immediately. Google offers free Cloud storage, and flash drives are inexpensive (and probably offered for free somewhere at your college). We've reached a point where ""my computer crashed"" is no longer a viable excuse to most professors.*
* *Beware of energy drinks. All-night study sessions and energy drinks are a tempting combination, but will seriously hurt your health in the long run.*
* *Try to acquire a credit card. If there are banks near the college (or affiliated with them), they may have cards specifically for college students. Now is the time you want to start building your credit.*

College is making me suicidal,9,7tq5mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7tq5mz/college_is_making_me_suicidal/,3,"Maybe it's not *the* thing that's causing it, but it sure as fuck is making it worse. I hate dragging myself to class every day and I hate physically being on campus. Being within 100 yards of that campus feels like a vampire is slowly sucking the life out of me. I hate making small talk with my professors, smiling and asking questions during class and generally acting like I give a shit about anything we're doing. I hate reading my textbooks, my attention issues have gotten so bad I can hardly read a few paragraphs before my brain starts crapping out. I hate all of the social pressures. How can I worry about connecting with professors and looking for internships to ""better myself and my future"" if I actively go out of my way to avoid making friends because it's too much responsibility and I feel like I'm barely hanging on just thinking about myself? And I hate going to sleep at night because I know I'll wake up. The only way I've kept my sleeping schedule somewhat regular is by getting high every night. Before I started using medical marijuana to get my sleep under control, my sleep was extremely fragmented and it was starting to take a toll on my overall health. Which isn't good, because I have a chronic illness as well (and you know how universities are *so* caring about students with health problems). 

This is just the tip of one big iceberg. If anyone knew what I was dealing with, how I think about suicide regularly, I know what they would say - drop out and take time to focus on yourself. But how can I? I'm not a poor student. I'm on the Dean's list and got all A's last quarter. And I'm already too far into this quarter, so the school won't give my parents any of their money back. It'll be another $5,000 of my parents hard earned money down the drain, and I can't fucking stand the idea of making this school that I hate so much just a little richer. I'm so angry. All I ever feel anymore is either anger, crushing anxiety, or sadness. I feel completely trapped. I've heard so many stories of people I went to school with (and know some of them personally) who couldn't cut it in college because of their emotional issues, so they dropped out and now spend their days working a menial job and pissing away their precious time. That can't be me. And I know it will be if I take time off, because if I do take time off, I'm not sure I'll be able to get myself to come back. I'm a junior now and have always disliked school, and it's only gotten worse with each passing year. I would see a psychologist, but I deal with a lot of paranoia, and the few times I've considered it I end up getting cold feet. I don't trust anyone, not even my own family. 

Have any of you who hate college ever taken time off? How did you get yourself to go back? Or did you end up not going back at all?  ","[""If it's making you suicidal then stop going after this semester. Nothing on this earth is more important than your mental health.

How do I salvage my undergrad so I can make it into grad school?,5,76za1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/76za1s/how_do_i_salvage_my_undergrad_so_i_can_make_it/,7,"I had a whole lot of complications arise so far in my college experience. My goal is to get into the pharmacology field. I spent two years at community college, one semester I lost by needing emergency surgery, another was part time for recovering. I transferred to a 4 year university. First year I did pretty good. Second year I really fucked up my grades due to my wife's health problems. My gpa dropped so I didn't get into the pharm and tox major I wanted. I then switched to biology. Now I'm in my 3rd year here. So far this semester I've got all A's. If I do summer and winter classes I can graduate after fall 2018. 

Even if all goes as planned from here on, I won't get into grad school. For the school I want, the average GPA is a 3.4 and right now I'm at a 2.7. If I ace every course from now on I still will be about a 3.2. I also need research experience. I can easily get into research here but I don't know how I'll be able to handle my courses, research, and working. I also need recommendations from 3 professors and I have no idea how to build relationships with them. 

I plan on talking with my advisor, but is anyone here able to give me some tips?","[""Aside from the obvious - still working hard to achieve well in your remaining courses so that you can boost that GPA even if ever so slightly - you want to make sure that you have a strong grad school application.\n\nResearch experience, as you mentioned, is one of the things that makes an application stronger, so you may have to figure out how to work around your courses, work, and research. I did it myself in the last semester of my undergrad, I was working full-time while doing a full semester online (it was over the summer so online was my only option) while also doing full-time research for the Dean of my university.\n\nYou have to make that effort if you want to get into grad school, and to be prepared for grad school, because you will have a LOT more of a workload - both in terms of classes and research - than in an undergrad, despite doing less classes. At least this would prepare you for that eventuality.\n\nAnother part of having a strong application is your references, which you also mentioned. To build relationships with your professors, simply talk to them about the course work -- you don't even necessarily need to be seeking help with the work, but simply stop by their office or approach them at the end of class to discuss something that you think is interesting about what you're learning. From there, continue to communicate with them.\n\nThe next part of a strong application is your research topic, because this shows the graduate admissions committee that you know what you're doing, that you're not just doing this for shits and giggles. You want to have a solid research topic chosen, and be able to explain to them what you want to do with it or why. This isn't a requirement - I certainly didn't have one chosen - but with such a low GPA, they may not be willing to take their chance on you unless they can see that you're serious about it.\n\nThe last part of a strong application relates to your research topic: a confirmed thesis/research supervisor. While this is also not a requirement at the application stage, this also shows the school how serious you are, because you've made the effort to cover all your bases by contacting them, doing your research on who to work with, etc. In addition, it shows the school that someone else has faith in your abilities, and that someone is willing to dedicate their time to helping you achieve that graduate degree, which is important when they're not certain about you."", "">For the school I want\n\nmight have to go to a different school, i don't think it m atters that much."", ""I don't know anything about grad school for your particular field, but is there any way you could get related work experience after undergrad? In my field many applicants to master's programs (most, in the top ones) have a couple years of professional experience. This would make you a stronger applicant overall.\n\nThe fact that you got good grades outside the semesters where you were experiencing serious hardship is something the grad school will take into account as long as you explain it on your application. If you are a strong applicant elsewhere (research, test scores, letters of rec) it will definitely not kill you. For now, focus on building relationships with professors by going to office hours and talking with them about the class and the field in general. If you do well in their classes and they can get to know you're driven to succeed in the field, professors will write good recommendations for you. Research with a professor is also a great opportunity to build a personal relationship while proving your skills and dedication.""]",10/17/17 19:28
Is this typical college stuff or a bad establishment?,1,9p197l,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9p197l/is_this_typical_college_stuff_or_a_bad/,0,"So I started community college in september 2016. Started as a social service worker student then figured I would go for a duel diploma year around. It was to much for me so I dropped down to just social service worker and of all things part time because I was so worn down eventually with no summer breaks.

So I have basicly been going for 7 straight semesters, I did get a grade defferal for this last sumer semester for health reasons so I got a break. It was not stress freel because I was looking for a placement and couldn't find one.

I just got a placement that I am exited to work at and told my supervisor only to be told that she has to get approval from the dean for me to start this late in the semester. The office told me I had a year to complete it but apparently the program wants me to do it in one semester.

How do i wait for this placement yes or no approval to the dean in a better way. I am extremely frusterated because the supervisor told me to keep looking for placement and never mentioned I would need the dean's approval.

So basicly I am entering my 7th semester to which I will get a diploma that only takes 4 semesters. I do have the option to go back and complete the 4 courses of mental health and addictions then placement which is only 2 semesters, but that would be 9 semesters for 8 semesters worth of school which seems more justifiable to me and I would get great satisfaction to complete both.

I have 4 classes on mondays and 5 on Wednesday’s and I’m not sure how to deal. I didn’t really have a choice, since chemistry for the health professions, A&P II lecture and lab, Percussion ensemble, and honors psychology only had time slots on those days. My day starts at 8 AM and ends at 4:45. The only class that isn’t a big deal is percussion ensemble, which is just an hour long jam session. But despite having percussion ensemble as a break I still feel drained. This was not my fault, because as I stated earlier those classes had only one time slot because the demand for those classes are pretty small, and all of those classes except for percussion ensemble are required. And if I drop percussion ensemble I won’t be able to get back in. I have been managing to do my homework in a stress free way, where I finish half of it two days before the next day of 5 classes, and the last half of it the day before. But I don’t know how to deal with the stress and the emotional exhaustion. If anyone has experienced this or is really good at stress management, I would really appreciate some tips.","[""Sounds pretty tough. Reminds me of one particular semester I had 19 units. I, like you, didn't have much of a choice, if I didn't take two of the classes I'd be stuck waiting another year and the other classes were prerequisites so I had to take them before, or do concurrent enrollment. \n\nRemind yourself the you're a badass. Be proud of the time you spend studying, it makes you better than many of the other individuals, not just at your school, but in college entirely. On my hell days I always rewarded myself. After I got out of school and before I had to go to work I'd always treat myself to a nice dinner, whatever I felt like, I'd justify the cost once a week. That helped me a lot, I had a goal from one week to the next. Find people in your classes to motivate you.

I suppose you just have to be hyper-organised and accept that you're going to feel worn out from it all.

If you're trying to socialise all the time, participate in lots of clubs, volunteer everywhere, and are travelling to see your family every weekend, then you'll crash and burn. When you have very intense days, you need to spend your off days actually recuperating. Studying at home, alone, can be better for you than studying in a group in that situation. \n\nAs for stress, you just have to keep moving forwards. Don't try to think far ahead into the future, don't even think further than next week for most things. Just worry about what tasks have been assigned now and when they need to be done by. Making your schedule is like predicting the weather: the further ahead you try to plan, the more times you'll have to make adjustments and the less in-control you'll feel.

I've had days that start at 5:30am and end around 8pm and when I have a shit lunch with a bunch of wasteful cards or some shit I will have the worst 2nd half of the day.

"10 Dorm Room Tips, Tricks, and Hacks every College Student needs to Know",65,43sqpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/43sqpf/10_dorm_room_tips_tricks_and_hacks_every_college/,8,"Going to college is likely going to be the first major change in your life, and for many people, it can be pretty overwhelming. But, if you are fully prepared, you can easily make the transition from home to college life. Take advantage of the following 10 tips to help you get through your college years.

#Stay Organized 

If you are disorganized, you are never going to accomplish anything. The better you are at organizing, and we mean organizing everything, the easier your life, and your college career, are going to be. Keep a weekly planner and write down every important thing that you need to do, from studying for exams to keeping appointments and then some.

#Use Your Resources 

While you are in college, you will have loads of resources available to you, from tutoring to library services to clubs to counseling and more. Take advantage of as many of these resources as possible.

#Get Involved 

While it is never a good idea to take on too much, especially in your first year, you should check out some of the campus clubs and organizations to see what interests you. This is a great way to make new friends, make connections for future employment, etc.

#Get Cheap Textbooks 

Textbooks are ridiculously expensive, but there are plenty of ways to get them without having to pay full price. Check out websites like Textbooks.com, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon. Don’t forget to ask students if they are selling their old textbooks, and look for other ways to get used textbooks.

#Follow Campus Rules

While this may seem like a no-brainer, there are a lot of people who will try and push the boundaries, because they are on their own for the first time. Remember, you are paying good money for your college education. The last thing you want is to get kicked out because you weren’t following campus rules.

#Take Care of Your Pets 

Because studies show that students often perform better when they have pets in their lives, more and more campuses are allowing students to keep small pets in their dorm rooms. If you have a pet, make sure that you take care of its health by having good insurance (start with comparing pet insurance at Pet Insurance University) to pay for vet care.

#Take Advantage of Your Student Discount 

There are loads of places that will offer student discounts, and you can save a lot of money by taking advantage of these discounts. Use as many as are available to you, for everything from school supplies to meals to electronic devices and more.

#Get a Mattress Topper 

Dorm beds aren’t necessarily the most comfortable beds in the world, but you need to get plenty of sleep to do your best in college. You can make your dorm bed a lot more comfortable by investing in a good mattress topper. The more comfortable you are, the more sleep you are going to get, and the more alert you are going to be in classes and when you are studying.

#Check Out Internships – 

If you want to see if you are going to like a career path, an internship is a great way to do it. You get to meet people in the industry, and you will learn a lot. Some companies even offer paid internships. Ask the guidance counselor about internship programs in the area.

#Relax and Enjoy Yourself 

Obviously, your main goal is to graduate and go on to a great career. But, don’t let yourself become overwhelmed by study. You also need to take time out for yourself, so you can relax and do things that you enjoy. If you let yourself get burned out with study and don’t have fun, things may not go as well as you had planned.

Also - never regret anything you learn a lesson from. Mistakes happen. Make sure they only happen once. \n\n#Don't pay for anything\n\nDon't ever pay for books if you can find them for free. Online services like khanacademy and mycodeschool, etc etc, are great if you aren't working from a textbook. Go to class for at least 3 weeks before buying a book. See if the professor actually works out of the book, or simply states it's part of the curriculum when it actually isn't. Also, shoplift. Only from big chains though. #supportyourlocalbusinesses\n\n#Talk to everyone\n\nYou have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You never know who you're gonna like or dislike until you just TRY to talk to them. \n\n#Fuck the rules\n\nCampus rules are important - these are the things you can't get caught doing. If you get caught once, it's usually forgivable. That's all you get though. Simple tip for not getting caught - establish open lines of communication with anyone that could be bothered by your unethical actions. Talk to your neighbors, make them feel comfortable with you. If you're too loud, they'll tell you. Same with your RA. If your roommate doesn't like you drinking alone and crying at 3 am every night, he should feel comfortable letting you know before getting RA's involved. It makes life so much easier if you aren't a dick. If you're fucking up bad enough that you get in trouble, it's not because you're doing bad things. It's because you're neglecting your relationships with those around you and you're being an asshole. Don't be loud. Don't break things. Don't throw up in public. Control the smell of weed. \n\n#Get your shit together\n\nFreshman year is the year to make mistakes. Sophomore year, if you must. Beyond that, keep your illicit activities controlled. They should NOT take over your life. There's thousands of kids out their that can handle their liquor and their grades, if you're not one of them, stop drinking and focus on school. Think about your future, not your weekend. \n\n#Relax and enjoy yourself\n\nGet your work done and THEN party. If you can do your homework high, then do it. But otherwise smoke after.

A message to Incoming Freshmen (Including Myself),3,4yaoia,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4yaoia/a_message_to_incoming_freshmen_including_myself/,6,"I've been thinking about college a lot lately, I'll be starting as a freshman next Monday move in on Saturday. The homesickness is already starting to kick in despite the fact I'm still at home and the dreaded ""What if?"" questions plague my mind. I'm trying to meditate and calm down before leaving for college so that my emotions don't overwhelm me. This feeling that this is the end I'm having is just corrupting my state of mind. When in fact, it will be the exact opposite when I leave for college. I will be fresh to start my own life. Yes, I will miss my family and friends but I know if I don't start my own life soon, I will only be dragging them down and that's not what I'm about.


I realized that the years in primary school was only the beginning, the closest thing to real life right now is college. I will no longer live in the same house for more than 6 months a year. In the next 4 years or so (depending if I want further education) I will be constantly moving every couple months to the dorm and my parent's house, then to my dorm again. ""Home"" is wherever I'll be sleeping for the night. I'll have to deal with random roommates, pay for housing, report if something goes wrong, buy my own stuff, cook/budget my own food, and be forced to make friends. These are teaching me important life lessons so I know I should be fortunate to practice these in a college setting.


Like many other students I won't deny I was trying to be the smartest kid in high school, did the highest education offered (Praise be to IB!), top of the class just because of weighted classes, but, I still slacked off senior year. Did all that shit for a pat on the back, a cool looking diploma, and couple thousand dollars (slacking off in senior year probably contributed to that). Now if I knew back then that my GPA didn't define my ability or my intelligence, I would of done more productive things and enjoyed life more (maybe not that much productive). Yes, I am grateful for all the things high school has taught me but, the best advice I learned was that I am worth more than a GPA.


I should enjoy college because I am paying for it, that's the difference. Hell yes, college will be challenging and sometimes you won't be doing the right decisions, and choosing an art major instead of the engineering major your parents are pushing you towards is better because fuck it, art makes you happy and you hate engineering.


You are the one making decisions now, however, the decisions you make now cost a hell a lot more, so think about it before you do anything. Whether it be partying, sex, picking a major, making friends, or even taking out loans. I already know money will be a pain in the ass to obtain and keep a hold of. you are still young so know how to budget. It's up to you to be able to make good judgements in all your decisions you make.


Also, don't worry if you fuck up. You still have your friends and family to support you even if they aren't physically there. Damn it, this is the digital age! You have texting, calling, and even Skype if you ever feel home sick or need someone to talk to (although, I know nothing can ever beat face to face). You are in college for a reason and there's a reason why you got in, you are smart. NEVER DOUBT YOURSELF. You are also doing this for your family, you want your parents to be proud of what you've become and what you've achieved. Never forget this. Always keep striving for your goal with a passion. There will be ups and down, there will be people who will try to deter you from your goal, and there will also be times where you doubt your ability. In the unfortunate turn of events where you begin to lose that passion remember what this goal means to you and every supporting you. Don't be afraid to seek help or give out help to others.

Lastly, know your limits. Trying to be on the soccer team, in a frat house, President of the art club creating a replica of the sistine chapel in the gymnasium down to the smallest of details that's due in a week, while doing 18 credit hours a semester, and being delivery boy at Papa Johns may not be the best for your well being and health.

If I were to give myself 5 tips for college it would be, be happy (most important), be healthy, learn to take/give criticism, remember why you're there to study smart, and be productive/take advantage of all the money you're paying by participating in club and events.

TL;DR I wrote myself a letter to learn and respect the ways of college hoping to motivate not only myself but others also new to college to take it head on confidently.

Hopefully, I will come back to this periodically and update my thoughts on college and see if my tips were actually helpful.","['[deleted]', ""You guys completely overrate the difficulty of transitioning to college.

1) I have been having health problems lately and I feel like I'd be more comfortable being close to family (who live in CA) 
2) I want to do something different for a semester. Almost like studying abroad.

Friend and I need help applying to community college since he was academically dismissed.,0,6c22vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6c22vr/friend_and_i_need_help_applying_to_community/,1,"I hope this is the correct subreddit. I'm really new here. Please help if I got it wrong. Thank you. And long post incoming.

A friend of mine f***** up. He was on academic probation and failed to improve his GPA. He was having a really hard time, academically/socially/mentally/etc, and kept thinking he could make it. I thought so too. He initially had C's in the courses (the ones he was retaking) before the final. Unfortunately, my friend did so bad on his finals for those classes that he got D's. Now he's on academic disqualification.

He was advised to attend community college for a year to make up his grades (and to save tons of money) to get reinstated. But he's given up on going back to that college. His GPA is shot to hell if he makes it back (failed a 4 and 5 unit course two times...) and might not be able to declare a major due to GPA requirements. We all hope he does well in community college and transfers to another college/university. 

Now he's applying to the community college back in our hometown, and there's a box that says, ""check here if you were expelled or in the middle of expulsion procedures."" His parents and my parents didn't know whether we should check it or not after we had asked. We don't want him to be dishonest at all, even by accident, since that can screw him over trying to get into community college. Should we check the box or not?

And any other advice for him like majors or helpful tips? I don't want him to stay in the med (and health?) field. He failed chem (for pre-nursing students) twice (the 5 unit course). He's absolutely crushed, but realized that the field isn't for him no matter how much he likes it. And my friend's still young. This was his first year in college.","[""I don't think expelling and being dismissed are the same thing.

What are my chances of getting into Brown as a homeschooler?,6,2pr5g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2pr5g8/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_into_brown_as_a/,4,"I have been home schooled for most of my high school career. This was due to many unfortunate health issues that I experienced over the past few years. First it was mono, this is what initially took me out of school during my freshman year. It took me months to recover so I missed my entire sophomore year. I worked very hard to get caught up with my studies and was eager to return to school as a junior. Only a few weeks in I landed myself in the hospital with viral meningitis. After that ordeal was over I was so far behind with my school work that my parents pulled me out of school and I began home schooling. I just wanted to give a little backstory so there is some explanation as to why I went this route. 

Now, I am finally graduating! I just received my GED (HiSET - High School Equivalency Test.. that is what is available in my state) with a score of 90 out of 100. For those who are unfamiliar, there is a series of five tests with fifty questions a piece. Each individual test has 20 as its highest possible score. To pass each section you must earn a score of 8 minimum, and 15 to demonstrate college readiness. I scored a 16 in writing, 17 in science, 18 in reading, 19 in math, and 20 in social studies. I am very much capable of earning better scores in writing and science but overall I am very satisfied with the outcome!

I have not yet taken the SATs due to a concussion (did I mention that I took 4 out of 5 of my HiSET tests with a concussion and scored higher than I did with a healthy brain!?). I will be taking it after I send in my college applications and there really isn't much that I can do about that situation. 

As far as academics go... I have met the requirements for most if not all schools. I even took a community college history course to prove my college readiness and received an A!

In addition to all of this I have many passions and interests. I love aviation. I have been saving up my money for flight lessons for the past few years and will be paying for it entirely on my own. I just recently started lessons and expect to earn my PPL by summer! I also spend a great deal of my time doing art, in fact, my top choice school is actually RISD. The reason I am interested in Brown is because of the RISD-Brown dual enrollment program. That is my ultimate goal.

I do not really have any volunteer worth other than helping out at a greyhound sanctuary when I was 13 and a farming sanctuary later on. I never really racked up any hours. For the past five years, when I wasn't sick, I was working on my education, working at a job to pay for flight lessons, or doing art. 

What does Brown think of homeschoolers? I know that RISD likes them very much because our curiosity and willingness to learn hasn't been stomped out by public school haha. Based on what I have written, what are my chances of getting into Brown? Is there any way to increase my chances of being accepted? For the record, I will not be devastated if I don't get in, my top choice is still RISD. My SATs will obviously play a huge role in this matter but unfortunately I don't have any to go by at the moment.

I would really appreciate any knowledge, tips, or just tidbits of information that anyone has to share!

Thank you!","[""To be honest, your chances are slim.  Not necessarily because of your homeschooling, but because:\n\n>I have not yet taken the SATs\n\n>I do not really have any volunteer worth\n\nBasically the school has no real way to judge the quality of your academics or your work ethic outside of school (and according to[ their admission page](http://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/apply/first-year-applicants) SAT or ACT scores are required, so you may not even be able to apply until taking one).  What were your grades like when you did attend high school?  You're required to send in your transcripts from any secondary school attended, so if they are exemplary that might help you a bit.\n\nRemember that the Ivies are difficult for *anybody* to get into.  Brown can fill it's freshmen class with 4.0 students.  You really have to have done something to stand out from the crowd, especially if you don't have a traditional academic record.  You might want to consider continuing at community college and transferring to university after a year or two."", ""Brown student, here. There are students here who are homeschooled. I don't think it would hurt your application. Regardless of where you went to school, it's really hard to get into Brown. If you had some sort of stats in terms of SAT scores then you could better gauge the likelihood of your acceptance. On your application you need to be able to sell yourself and that you would be a good fit at Brown. This comes from not only grades, because a lot of people get good grades. I've heard that recs are really important; however, the whole process really is just a big crapshoot. Just want to throw in that people who are in the dual-enrollment are brilliant (those that I have met, at least).

I Posted This in r/Gradschool a Few Weeks Ago But it Might Help Somebody Here Too: Advice/Feel Good Post: I Appealed Academic Dismissal and Lived to Tell the Tale.,8,4ejvos,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4ejvos/i_posted_this_in_rgradschool_a_few_weeks_ago_but/,1,"Basically due to an array of mental health and personal clusterfucks my grades for the last two semesters were garbage. After last semester I was placed just below the threshold of academic standing. Today I just found out that my appeal was granted and I get another semester to pull my shit together. I do however want to share some tips based on my experience of how to have a successful appeal process. (1) Know your schools bylaws: read the student hand book and know the requirements for academic standing, and the formal process of an appeal like the back of your hand. Odds are that you will be more on top of the rules and the process than the faculty themselves. Hell, I did not receive my formal dismissal letter until about a week in to school and received my grades a week and a half before THAT. You would be surprised how remarkably unorganized and unprofessional some faculty can be (a moment particularly standing out was the director of academic success stating that it was ""inconvenient for [him] to open an attachment"") (2) Get as much documentation as humanly possible: A lot of you who are reading your student handbooks will notice something to the effect of ""In order to approve readmission the [dean] must feel that your grades were caused for reasons beyond your control."" This pretty much means that they want a mental health issue, death, or horrible accident. Once you submit your request to who ever wants it, have some sort of documentation readily available supporting your reason. (3) I personally did not have to but it is entirely possible you will have to meet with some sort of committee they will pretty much want you to convey the following: A. Some sort of academic success plan for increasing your grades involving actions and strategies. They do not want somebody who is going to just do the same thing for one more semester. B. Make sure you express gratitude to all those involved. Odds are this process is taking place right at the beginning of a semester and it is the last thing an already overburdened facility wants to deal with. C. A desire to stay, something lie ""I really enjoy it here."" goes a long way and will ad pathos to an appeal. Well, now I am here, I am still going to have to haul ass, but at least I have some time to fix my shit. I hope this helps somebody out there.

How to get into a good school when coming from an unconventional background?,6,2gnrvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2gnrvm/how_to_get_into_a_good_school_when_coming_from_an/,3,"I hope that this is the place to ask this! 

I'll try to make this as brief as possible but my story is very long. 
To make it short.. I was very very sick (physically not mentally!) from the end of my freshman year of high school (2011) to the beginning of my junior year. I was in and out of the hospital, misses a lot of school, and eventually had to withdraw and homeschool. I had to go through tons of physical therapy to even be able to walk again. I had originally worked very had to go back to school junior year, I got completely caught up.. but then I got sick again shortly into the school year and that's when I left for good. Over the past two years my family and I have resolved my health issues and now I am a perfectly happy, healthy, functioning individual. 

I am now in my fifth year of ""high school"" because I am still behind due to being so sick. I am completing all of the credits that I need to this year through a mix of community college courses, tutors, and my own research. I have been working SO hard and I'm prepared to work even harder. It has been really hard seeing all of my friends leave for college when I know that I'm ready to go as well.. I just don't have the right credits.

My top choice is RISD (Rhode Island School of Design). I hate throwing away my modesty but I have to be honest for the sake of this question.. I am a talented artist and from that perspective, I have what it takes to get into the school. However.. I'm worried about what my academics will look like to them. I also haven't taken the SATs yet and I'm nervous about that. RISD stresses good grades equally as much as a strong portfolio, they look at it all. 

I'm going to speak with admissions about my situation soon.. we'll probably even have to have follow up meetings.. They'll probably remember me there because my background is so unconventional. I want to do whatever I can to get involved there too.. like taking classes for example. Maybe I'll even ask for an interview. I want to do whatever it takes to establish my presence there and get a bit of a foothold.

I know that everyone needs to have a second and third choice and we need to be happy with those schools if we do not get into our first choice... But I have to say.. after everything that I've gone through, I just want something to go right. I don't think that I'm entitled to anything.. but after all of this.. 

Any tips from people who come from similar schooling backgrounds would be much appreciated! As well as any strategies to increase your odds of getting into a school (other than getting good grades and in my case, having a good portfolio.. I'll be doing these things anyway).

I apologize for the length of this!

I'm literally shaking right now, my chest is tight, I have no appetite, my limbs feel numb...I want to cry...im probably having a panic attack >.>

1) First of all, I seriously dont know what I want to major in. Im stuck between nursing, something involving therapy or social work, or something in art. For the longest time, I thought I wanted to be a nurse, but I've been reading up on how intense nursing school is, how its soooo competitive, how stressful it is, and nursing itself is a stressful job. A part of me thinks I would like it, but another part of me worries that I'll hate it...I mean, I dont handle stress well. And Im worried about my grades. I already have two C's in two college classes I took during my senior year of highschool, and I definitely could have gotten A's in those classes, I just slacked off like crazy, and I wish I hadn't. Im worried that It'll kill my GPA...I like the fact that there's a lot of flexibility in nursing, the job stability, the pay, and the fact that you're helping people. But nurses also can be overworked and generally stressed out...Im scared y'all! lol

I was also thinking of doing something with art because I love to draw and I've been told that I should go to art school because im good at drawing, but Im worried about job stability and pay. I dont want to be rich, but I dont want to be poor and worrying about bills--nobody does. Job stability is very important to me. I would love to do something with art because it is my passion, but I know that your passion doesn't have to turn into your career.

And finally, I was thinking of becoming a social worker or Marriage and Family Therapist. However, even with a masters, the pay isn't too good. I'd love to make a positive difference in marriages and families, and teach people skills necessary to keep their families and marriages happily together. However, I dont want to be paid peanuts for pursuing a masters degree...

2) Im shy. Like, really shy, and quiet. I had friends in school, but I've only seen like one of them outside of school this past summer..so, I guess we weren't close friends, but were able to talk and goof off in school. In college, I would love to have a close knit group of friends...just a couple of people. So we can just hang out and do stuff. Im a homebody, not gonna lie, but there are days when I'd like to hang out with someone but dont have anyone to hang out with. It kinda sucks ;(

3)Money. My mom is gonna pay for my text books (I would pay if I had a job, but I have a health problem that limits what I can do...Im working on getting it under control so that I'll be healthy to pursue nursing, if I choose to do so.) I feel terrible and guilty, because the money can go towards other things...my family isn't well off at all, and my mother lives paycheck to paycheck...I feel so terrible, I cant even begin to explain it....

Im freaking out...tips please?","[""1) You are going into your first year of community college. Not only are classes affordable, but you have such a wide variety of classes you can take. If you follow your GEs, you will be able to find something you like. It's great that you have so many interests! I would recommend you search Public Health programs. I would recommend researching art programs, but I do not see specificity in what kind of art. You do have time to find what you want to pursue, regardless. \n\n2) Talk to people in your class. Go study with them. Being shy isn't a very good excuse. I consider myself shy, too, but you need to realize that learning how to network is an essential skill. Take the leap.

"For anybody whose withdrawn from a class, how easy is the application process?",2,jbbbdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jbbbdr/for_anybody_whose_withdrawn_from_a_class_how_easy/,5,"So I’m doing absolutely horrible in this intro programming class, and i have just an abysmal grade and the professor kind of sucks, and the format for the class sucks. I talked to an advisor and he says that I need to go through all these steps and that they just need compelling reason for me to withdraw from this class.

And so the advisor said I can email my therapist since I recently started seeing a therapist since covid. My grandma with dementia also stays over for periods at a time and there’s 6 people at my house and I just can’t sit down and studying or do long assignments like I used to. 

I honestly just can’t bring myself to do all this shit for this one class and like the professor just doesn’t get it and hasn’t been accommodating. I have emails that show I’ve been asking for help since the beginning but he just gives me generic ass answers and he’s just a computer science nerd so I feel like he’s just not getting my struggle. If the class was u see normal pre covid circumstances then I feel like I wouldn’t have an argument but this class is just too much  and I want to withdraw rather than tank my GPA.

Hopefully the therapist is understanding when I ask him if I can get an email, and also the advisor said he can write me an additionally email supporting me. I really don’t want to have to ask for documentation for my grandma having dementia, (since then I’ll have to get the extended family into my business bc my other aunt is in charge of her medical visits). 

So I’m just gonna cite mental health reason with therapist to hopefully support me, the advisor said he would write something, and then I’m just gonna go into persuasive mode in saying how covid has affected me and being at home and stuff. 

It feels kind of like an intimidating process but I have like a 30% in the class and I just failed the midterm completely a couple days ago, so it’s just really not going well so I know gotta do it.","['Just to drop one class?

Need Advice: Am I happy in College?,1,j8qosi,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j8qosi/need_advice_am_i_happy_in_college/,1,"I have been going through a bit of an emotional dilemma I really need help with. I recently started my first year of college and I don't know if I like it yet. I think my classes are interesting and I'm waiting for them to pick up. But it's been almost a month and I don't love what I'm doing.  I am having a lot of battles in my mind about my expectations vs reality of being at college and its exhausting.

I think COVID has taken a huge toll on me. I am having a very hard time staying attentive in my online classes, I came to college for hands-on learning cause that's best for me. I think once COVID is over I'll like my classes more but I'm worried that even after COVID I won't enjoy my program. I can't tell if the problem is COVID, the program or both. 

COVID has also been super detrimental to my mental health, I moved to residence this year even with COVID because I wanted the experience and so did my parents. Everyone told me how amazing residence was gonna be and how much fun it is and how they're so happy they did it. But getting here, having to distance and feeling the need to isolate yourself is hard. I am a super extroverted person, and while there are residence events, I've made good friends, and I really like having my own environment I function super well. But being alone is draining. I want to feel like I don't have to be alone, but even going to people's rooms makes me nervous cause I have so much COVID-related anxiety. 

Many other factors in my life are contributing to me feeling shitty lately. But I can't figure out if I'm happy. I think I'm currently at a low point mentally and it's making me overthink everything. It feels like waiting till COVID is over might help so much, but what if it doesn't end? And I wasted thousands on a wish that a pandemic would go away?

It\'s the worst of what college has to offer, to be honest. \n\n> But I can\'t figure out if I\'m happy.\n\nYou don\'t need to figure it out now. One month in is nothing. \n\n> It feels like waiting till COVID is over might help so much, but what if it doesn\'t end?\n\nIt will end. Even in a worst case scenario with no vaccine, it will end. My understanding of viruses is that like everything else, their trajectory is at the whim of the nature of evolution. Only the strains that reproduce survive, and those that don\'t reproduce die off. You know what makes it very hard for a virus to reproduce? Killing a person. The virus can\'t spread from a dead person. \n\nThis is a long winded way of saying that nature tends to make viruses weaker over time, and covid is no exception. Even without a vaccine, covid will most likely eventually become so weak that we can handle having it around. And that\'s the *worst* case scenario where we *don\'t* have a vaccine. There was no vaccine for the Spanish Flu. Shit sucked for a while back then. Eventually it got weak and people went back to normal. The Spanish flu believe it or not is still around.

Shortened/Voided Fall Breaks,1,j6jvlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j6jvlf/shortenedvoided_fall_breaks/,3,"So I'm writing this at the end of my so-called 'fall break', and I'm just curious to see who else feels the same. My college has cut fall break to two days (it was Monday, and today), which would have been fine since the weekend exists, right?

Well. Something about covid has made professors feel really great about dropping due dates regularly on Saturdays and Sundays, so - those two days didn't really feel like much of a break. Which brings it down to two days. However, with a bio lab practical on Friday that I need to study for, and a psych exam the following Monday, not to mention 30-40 hours of /work/ in general outside of school - I'm exhausted. And I know that about this point in the semester is really where I usually feel tired, but it's also when we usually get at least an uninterrupted 3 or 4-day break. I mean for christ's sake, we even had homework on labor day. 

Don't get me wrong, I know I definitely don't have the worst time in all this. In fact, a quick google search showed that a lot of colleges are cutting out breaks entirely. I feel like this is just going to end up hurting us students in the end. I am so god damn overwhelmed it's not even funny. The lack of an actual break is grating on my mental health. Hell, I missed an assignment just because my brain feels so cluttered and busy that I somehow overlooked it. I bet you, even professors need the breaks too, the constant stream of grading work has to hurt...

So, are any other schools you guys go to doing this?

I am in a bad situation with a horrible roommate to the point I had a nervous breakdown. My roommate is a sociopath that got covid on purpose so she could purposely infect her sugar daddy so he would stay with her regardless knowing her actions affect me. She lets her dog use the bathroom in the apartment, soiled puppy pads and feces everywhere.  This has been going on for months and even after many conversations she doesn’t care. I have become that dogs owner because she neglects him. She sees him as an accessory for her social media.

I am at a friends house currently, and weighing my options. My apartment told me the only way out is to pay my lease in full.   This would be $3,500. currently have $1700 in savings  and need   $1800 to pay off the balance. I don’t think my mental health can last anymore in this situation. I work full time and not once but twice, I have had to quarantine for 2 weeks because of her. If this wasn’t a factor I know I could white knuckle it and  hoard my paychecks. I’ll eat rice and beans, but with her there is no stability, accountability, or consciousness of her actions.  I have set ads out for a sublease but have had no takers. So my option looks like I’ll have to pay my lease and full. All the utilities are in my name so I am making sure everything is accounted for  before I move out and disconnect them.

Even though I have threatened leaving she doesn’t care. 98% of the apartment is furnished by me and if I leave she has a bed and a shower curtain. She doesn’t understand you call to set up electricity and I am to the point I dot want to give her notice and just disconnect the electrify and water without giving her the option to switch it in her name.

Am I wrong for regretting going to college?,6,j1rerq,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j1rerq/am_i_wrong_for_regretting_going_to_college/,0,"Before you read on, no I didn't choose a useless degree and no I won't graduate with 40k in student loan debt. In fact, I won't have to pay a dime in student loans because the Pell Grant paid for everything luckily. I'm graduating in December with good grades from an online public health education program here in NC at a state university where I live. I'm 29 years old, going to be 30 next month and I have a 5 year old. I've worked the entire 2 years I spent finishing my bachelor's degree and I hated every moment of it. I'm burned out, exhausted, and downright crabby all the time it seems now. I don't recognize myself these days. 

I regret it because I missed out on a lot of time spent with my son. I'm sad that I had to essentially hand him off to someone else for catching up on homework, doing quizzes/tests, etc. I did it all in the name of trying to better my and especially my son's future. But this has come at a great price. 

You see, I've struggled with depression for many years but now my anxiety is through the roof. I haven't been able to really enjoy much of my life since I went to school. Heck, I've been feeling rushed to do simple things like bath time with my kid. Why? I'd have homework to finish or a test to study for, or just catching up on other household chores. Did I mention I've been working full-time the entire time I've been in school?

If I could do it allover again, I would pick a certificate program that'd be guaranteed to land me a good job at a fraction of the opportunity cost and not to mention my already questionable mental health. Am I going to be happy graduating with a 3.9 from a decent university (maybe slightly lower because my grades are not all As in my last 9 credit hours lol)? I sure hope so, even though I decided after the way the CDC, WHO and our general healthcare system handled this COVID-19 thing, I'd be embarrassed to work in such a corrupt system with short-sighted, narrow-minded folks running the show. 

Many doors have shut on me during my time pursuing a career in healthcare. I was denied a promotion 4x at the lab I worked at for almost 5 years, was refused positions that'd transfer me out to better hours and higher pay 6-7x at the same lab, dropped out of a cardiovascular technology program 8 years ago, and hundreds of job applications at local hospitals all denied. Oh and don't get me started on me losing a job as a medical receptionist at a pediatrician's office after 6 weeks last year. I should've listened to the signs a long time ago health care is not my calling. I love science with a passion but I think it's more meant to be a money making hobby on the side or something. 

Tl;dr: I regret going to college because I feel I lost out on quality time with my adorable 5 year old son and think the universe has been trying to tell me healthcare isn't for me for a good while. If I could do it allover again, I'd pick a certificate and other MOOCs for credentials to get me a good paying job. Kids, don't feel like you must go to college, it's really not for everyone!

Mid-degree gap year???,1,j18pyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j18pyv/middegree_gap_year/,0,"Hey y'all, I hope I'm posting in the right place.

I'm an Australian archaeology major at the ANU, and I'm 2 years into my 3.5 year degree.

I've wanted to pursue a career in archaeology since I can't remember, and uni life is great but with COVID (having to work 3 jobs to make up for dropped shifts) and some mental health issues resulting from it all, I'm losing my motivation. I get students go through patches of questioning their degrees and feeling helpless, but I'm honestly at the end of my rope and have been for a while.

I'm thinking of taking a year (or 6 months) off instead of jumping into third year, maybe to go teach English in Korea (my mans is Korean, he's very enthused) or just work full time and save up to travel in the second half of the year. So far, I've completed about 15 years of schooling *straight* and haven't had time off to travel or save...

""You won't want to go back"" is what I often hear, but honestly I can't see myself without a degree in the end, and I do love uni life and research. To be a successful archaeologist these days it's necessary to enter graduate studies, and I have no intention of changing my career goals. I'm already working at a museum as a casual, so my foot is in the door, so to speak.  


It's easy to say, but I will be completing this degree - I've also just been burning the candle at both ends and my grades are slipping as a result... Most of my friends have taken a gap year already, and I'm feeling a bit 'treat yoself' about it all...

The answer seems a little obvious, but I guess I'm looking for affirmation from anyone going through a similar experience who might be able to tack me down and tell me it's okay (anxiety does wonders for life decisions, amirite?).

TLDR; I'm stressed, aint blessed and feeling like I need a big ol' time out from uni.

I dont think I have the strength to continue to have these problems when I transfer to UNI, I want a proper start, or at least something close. At least of I take a gap semester I will not be in school until January 2021 and maybe things will be looking up or getting back to normal then.

Meanwhile I can use this extra no school time as an advantage to WORK. I am not going to go into details but I cannot live at home anymore because I cannot take it. Saving my damn emotional and a bit of my mental health by skirting out of there. May 2021 I need to be out of that house. At least if I am not in school I can work full time and not worry about school, tuition, and student loans. I can just focus on myself, my job, and my happiness for fucking once.

I really hate these times, I was in such a low point during May that my friend had to comfort me over snap to make sure I didnt overdose on a bunch of Ibuprofen. It seems stupid and wild af to me now because I am somewhat emotionally stable, but I was a mess back in may and it seemed tempting to take a bunch of pills and pass out for a few days and avoid life for a while","['If you’re finding yourself not motivated for school, a gap semester (or year) can be a really good thing. Finding a job you like might be hard during the pandemic, so keep an open mind about possibilities. \n\nAlso, if you have any student loans, you may need to start making payments if you aren’t in school. Check with your financial aid office for details. \n\nAnd, if your college has a career center, take advantage of them.

Having a stressful time trying to adapt to Online college,11,iteyhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iteyhg/having_a_stressful_time_trying_to_adapt_to_online/,1,"It's already week 3 and I've received many zeros just because of the sheer amount of procrastination on my part and my unwillingness to do any zoom or face to face meetings.

I am feeling kind of depressed academically because I do not have the ability to go to a library and my environment is taking a huge toll on my mental health. Before back before the pre-covid altered world, I used to get all my work done in a library but working at home as been very stressful and difficult, and I just cannot get myself to work in such a environment where noise is abundant and im simply just too afraid to get any work done without a solid desk as you would see in a library or internet cafe without any distractions whatsoever.

Combine that with the fact that online school is very difficult for me and my mental health has been at a nearly all time low for the past few months. We are only a month into classes and I'm at freak out levels I normally only get to during dead week. I've got an assignment, project and two labs due the next two days and all of it is taking tons of time. Not to mention I need to be applying for internships by now.  


I feel like I need to withdraw from one of my courses, the most time consuming one that is confusing me. If it wasn't past the drop point I'd do it right now, but it feels like a bad idea to withdraw now when I could just wait it out and see if I can manage. On the other hand, my mental health is pretty fucked and waiting it out is likely to just make me spend the next few months in a constant freak out for the same result.

My mom had a stroke earlier this year and is unable to work. My dad lost his airport porter job due to COVID so he is collecting unemployment. The amount he's getting is small and he is unable to find a job due to his incompetence and unwillingness to find a job. I try to help him apply for jobs, but he is unqualified for most of them so his only option is to work manual labor. However, he is in his 60s and his health is deteriorating so I don't know how I can help him anymore. My older brother dropped out of school because he lost motivation to continue and works as a security guard. However, the pay is inconsistent as he barely gets called to work. Most of the time, he's on his computer playing games. I work as a server at a restaurant, but have decided to take a leave of absence to focus on school and my mental health.

How to overcome anxiety during the beginning of a semester?,12,il14w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/il14w3/how_to_overcome_anxiety_during_the_beginning_of_a/,1," I'm in my 4th semester at a local community college and should be graduating this December. COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on my mental health and has caused me great distress. I haven't seen my girlfriend since early February due to travel bans (she lives in England). Although I'm able to go there, it's hard to manage flying there with my school schedule. Not being able to see her has completely destroyed me, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I stay up at night crying. Now school has started, which is always a source of severe anxiety for me. It really puts my anxiety disorder into high gear and my mind goes into complete panic. I have to finish up some required courses for my degree and it's freaking me out. One of them being art. I was never good at art and never had an interest and it's so mentally deteriorating for me to take a mandatory fine arts course. I haven't eaten in two days and have lost around 5 lbs. I'm prescribed Klonopin and Ativan to help with my severe panic attacks but they aren't helping anymore. I'm just not sure what to do or how to go about it. I feel like I'm drowning in work this semester and I'm afraid I may drop out. My first year that I was supposed to attend university was the fall of 2017 and I ended up succumbing to my anxiety and taking a medical leave. I enrolled in a CC the next fall and maintained a 3.77 GPA. Come the spring semester of 2019, my dog had a seizure in my arms and died on the morning school started and that was probably when I hit my lowest point in my entire life. To this day, I still struggle from what had happened. I made it through a full year this past year and maintained a 4.0 GPA through both semesters. Now, this is supposed to be my last before I move on from CC and I'm paralyzed with anxiety and fear once again and not knowing what I should do. I was debating on taking 3 courses this semester and then 2 in the spring to lessen the load and stress, especially since I'm doing courses that aren't my strong suits.  I'm not even sure if I want to continue to a 4 year school. I feel like I really need to take time to heavily focus on my mental health because there's no way I can succeed in the current state that I'm in.","['Take a moment and breathe.\n\nThis year sucks, and you are not alone.  \n\nYou are succeeding despite your challenges. There is no shame in dialing back a tough schedule to make it more manageable while you are working on your health. Anything that gets you closer to your ultimate goals is still moving you forward.  Exercise, sleep, and eating good food contribute to more stable mental health.  When your mental and physical health are strong, challenges don\'t seem so overwhelming.\n\nOn fine arts classes: \n\nYou may be in luck finding an online class for which you won\'t need to actually create art.  I have a friend taking ceramics this year (at a top 10 university!), and he only needs to watch videos and write reflections. \n\nAnother idea: Computer graphics/graphic design can be considered a ""fine art"".

Live off campus or stay home and save money?,2,iicct1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iicct1/live_off_campus_or_stay_home_and_save_money/,6,"Hi everyone! So I’m 20M and I’m a junior this year and due to covid every single class is online. In March (before covid) I had signed a lease that started in July with one of my friends from high school and 2 others I knew very well from college. Classes started August 24 and currently I am home but got stuck with the lease paying 750 a month  plus some utilities which would be around $75. Everyone already moved in and are keeping their lease but I am in a tough spot bc I want to live at the place off campus bc I really can’t concentrate at home and the environment that I’m surround in (I’m a pre-pt student btw) and I’m taking 19 credits because I’m a little behind. Im a very happy and outgoing person but even though classes just started I feel like my mental health would go down. On the other hand, multiply about 850 a month (which would include groceries) times 9 which would equal $7650 give or take. So I had just found someone that would be interested to take the lease but I am hesitant because I’m not sure if there will be in person classes in the Spring and if there are it would be hard to find somewhere to live close by. On the flip side I could battle this out and stay home and possibly save roughly $7700 to either put in towards a new car or save it and invest it.

My Advice for Students during COVID,21,igipl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/igipl1/my_advice_for_students_during_covid/,4,"I'm a professor and run a blog/Instagram account for college students called - The Student Collective. I put together this list of tips for students as they begin a new semester during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

1. **Know your university’s policies.** Many universities and professors are making changes to their policies to accommodate these extenuating circumstances. Check out your university’s COVID guidelines as well as notes in your course syllabi and announcements from your professors. Some things to watch for - Are there extended drop/add periods? Are there alternatives for grading such as a pass/fail option? Are your professor’s assignment deadlines strict or suggested? Keep these in mind as you go forward in your semester. Be sure to bookmark this page for quick reference should any issues come up! 
2. **Create a sick plan.** Despite taking all recommended precautions - wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, limiting your outings - there is still a chance you could become infected with COVID-19. It is so important that you are familiar with [the symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and the procedures of your health center and/or doctor’s office should you develop symptoms. Additionally, you should have a plan in place should you need to quarantine from being exposed or becoming ill. Things to consider in your sick plan:

* A contact person - a friend, roommate, or family member - to check in on your wellbeing and help if needed 
* Health/medical supplies - thermometer, insurance card, big water jug, Ibuprofen, ice packs, kleenex
* A comfortable place to quarantine and things to keep you entertained (computer charger, phone charger, books, puzzles)
* Quick, easy, nutritious meals that you keep in stock should the need arrive (frozen fruit for smoothies, quick meals, soups, or pasta, Gatorades)
* Contact information for notifying your professors, boss, university officials, etc. at the onset of your illness/quarantine

**3. Tap into your university’s resources.** Many services that are typically offered at your university are now adapting to an online version but they are still available to you. Your school gym might be offering online fitness classes; your mental health center might be offering virtual counseling sessions, and the writing center might be giving one-on-one virtual coaching. Universities might have technological equipment such as laptops for you to borrow and campus organizations might be holding virtual meetups. Tap into these resources! You’re already paying for them - put them to use!

4.**Have a COVID discussion with the people you live with.** It is essential that you have a conversation with the people you live with about boundaries, rules and expectations for one another during this season in order to protect everyone’s safety and comfort. Where is it okay to go? Who is it okay to interact with? What are the rules about keeping your home safe? What is the protocol for when you come back into the home after being outside? Each decision one of you makes could potentially affect the other so it is important that everyone is on the same page. You can also revisit this topic throughout the semester as the situation evolves.

5. **Stay informed.** It is valuable to keep an eye on[ the COVID data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) for your community as well as the policies that officials are putting in place. While overload of this type of data can be detrimental, it is necessary that you are vigilant in order to protect yourself and the rest of your community. 

6. **Pay attention to trends in your health and wellbeing.** While COVID-19 is presenting as a huge threat to our health, we cannot neglect the other pieces of our wellbeing while in quarantine. It is important to monitor your mood, activity level, sleep, and diet and make changes accordingly to maintain your wellbeing. I’ve started tracking my food and sleep using the FitBit app, and I have been going on daily walks in addition to my daily workouts to make sure I am still moving my body and getting some fresh air and Vitamin D. Find ways to still maintain your wellbeing and don’t hesitate to contact your doctor if you notice any alarming or drastic trends in your health. 

7. **Monitor and care for your mental health.** As someone who has a history of anxiety, OCD, and depression, I know all too well the dangers that this type of reality presents for our mental health. Keep track of your thoughts and feelings and notice any shifts in your mentality and wellbeing. Remember that our thoughts can lie to us! It’s important to have a proactive strategy in place to confront negative or unproductive feelings and reframe, redirect or dispel them from your mind. I will be sharing another blog post soon about the different mental strategies I have been using during this time that have helped me tremendously. Lastly remember that action is the best antidote for anxiety and depression. So when you feel those doubting or sinking thoughts creep in, propel yourself into action: begin your schoolwork, go for a walk or do a workout, call a friend. These actions will not only distract you from your thoughts, but they will replace them with a better feeling. As always, if you have thoughts of harming yourself or others or feelings/experiences that are extremely dark, dangerous, or uncomfortable, make contact with a mental health professional and/or reach out to someone you trust.

8. **Take charge of your quarantine life.** While COVID is putting a huge strain on what we had envisioned 2020 to look like, it does not mean we have to sit this entire year out. We can still have a fruitful, joyful, productive year, but it is up to us to create a productive, happy “new normal” and hold ourselves accountable. Take control of your schedule, your mindset, and your priorities and build for yourself a meaningful 2020.

9. **Use this time to your advantage.** Many of us have suffered from feeling a lack of control in this situation. This thing is happening around us, happening to us, and we are simply in survival mode. How could you make this season work for you rather than against you? It might be a time to take all of those hard classes and get them out of the way. Maybe you decide to take the year off from school to work and save money. Maybe you’ve been in desperate need of a break to relax and recharge or heal from some of the challenges you’ve faced recently. Or did you ever have an idea in the back of your head but you never found the time to dedicate to it? Such as a side hustle you wanted to start or health/fitness goals that you wanted to achieve or learning how to cook or paint. Could it be now? Rarely are we graced with such a simple season that is uninterrupted by external pressures and demands. How could you come out of this season stronger, more authentic, more productive, and closer to achieving your goals?

10. **Be creative.** I've said a million times - we can’t just watch Netflix for a whole year until this thing is over! You have to find creative ways to maintain the components of your life that are fulfilling to you. Missing being around other people? Organize a virtual hangout or game night with friends or family. In a relationship? Plan an in-house date night. Get dressed up and cook a fancy meal. Single but wanting to mingle? Dating is not canceled! Keep swiping, messaging, and offer a Facetime date. This is the true test of compatibility! Sad you’re not able to travel this year? (This is me!) Do all of the research and plan the trip of your dreams for when the world opens up again!

What else would you add???","[""I'll emphasize the need for mental health support at this time. Most colleges and universities offer mental health services and/or can refer students to resources. Take full advantage of that. Depression and anxiety are already common in college students, now they're far more likely to be a problem. Take care of yourselves. Don't ever be reluctant to reach out to friends, professors, and staff for help."", ""It might be wise to add that you don't have to do something productive with your extra time (assuming you have it). There has been a lot of pressure during the virus to pick up a new hobby or do a new product but I must say that you shouldn't feel inadequate if you don't do those things. The virus has everyone frantic and adding more pressure to be productive doesn't make it any better.""]",8/25/20 23:04
What would you like to see out of an LGBTQ+ Student Center given the restrictions of COVID-19?,1,igjovi,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/igjovi/what_would_you_like_to_see_out_of_an_lgbtq/,8," 

Hello! My name is Caleb, and I am a graduate clinical social work student. For my field practicum, I am developing the recently opened LGBTQ+ Student Center on campus, which provides individual mental health services, outreach, advocacy, and policy change. I asked a similar question on this subreddit a long time ago and received many responses, and I am hoping to gain some more insight on how we can be helpful even with the restrictions of COVID-19. We will be primarily working with undergraduate students, but I would love to hear ideas from anyone.

Here are some specific questions, but please share anything you would like!

1. It seems to me that Zoom events/social clubs just aren't as fun, and people do not attend them as regularly as in-person Pride events. However, we want to ensure that we are still connecting with LGBTQ+ students on campus. What would be the best ways for us to do so?
2. Would you be interested in a podcast where LGBTQ+ Student Center staff interview LGBTQ+ alumni/professors about their stories, such as coming out, challenges specific to their sexuality/gender identity, and career?
3. Former/current undergraduate students: What were/are the biggest challenges you faced transitioning from high school to college as a member of the LGBTQ+ community? What services on campus could have helped you to address or mitigate these challenges?

I appreciate the help so much! With your help, we hope to ensure LGBTQ+ students on campus have a warm, welcoming, and empowering environment.","[""I've always wished my school had some sort of LGBTQ+ groupchat or something so I could make actual LGBTQ+ friends. Most of the events I've seen at centers aren't my style."", ""To me, one and two sound great. I just want to add onto three.\n\nSafe sex practices and how sex might work for other couples, which is important because you never know what background anyone is coming from. A heterosexual(or even just make/female) couple having sex, which is probably most commonly taught, is going to be completely different than a lesbian or gay couple or whoever else in the LGBTQ+ community having sex. Hopefully people aren't having sex during a pandemic, but it's college, and it's probably helpful anyway so someone who doesn't have a way to ask can have resources without any stigma surrounding it. \n\nI also don't know where you are located or where students live before coming to university, but I think now is a great time to implement how to come out if they wish to parents/family/whoever if they feel comfortable, especially if they're in an anti-LGBTQ+ area. Or, at the very least, a way of coping with the loss of expected freedom from any of those views and how to live when surrounded with these views. It's a challenging time, and everyone's feeling it, and I'm sure you're already aware of the high levels of mental illness and suicide rates tied to LGBTQ+ individuals. A pandemic isn't going to make it drop drastically, and being cut off from a safe space might make it harder for someone. It's a good topic for discussion, or to at least have thought about, in case someone comes looking for that support."", 'wtf corona got to do with being gay', '1.

My school is essentially forcing me to stay in more dorm room 24/7 only going outside to get food and punishing me for having guests.,0,icqawr,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/icqawr/my_school_is_essentially_forcing_me_to_stay_in/,23,"My situation is stupid IMO when I am living on campus, I am essentially going to be in my dorm 24/7, I am not allowed to go off-campus, or go to another dorm, or have guests over. They are basically forcing me to be alone for the next 4 months. No this is not an exaggeration, they literally say guests are not allowed, and I would be punished if I have one. 

This makes it so even if I take the most precautions, like getting my guest tested, quarantining my guest for 14 days doing literally everything possible to get my single guess to not have COVID, I still won't be able to get them. The obvious reason is that the school doesn't know how many precautions my guest has taken, they immediately think my guest has come out of the seware and assume they are COVID ridden. 

Obviously I get the school doesn't have time for my shit, but like if you are going to punish me for having a guest and aren't allowing me any other options you are legitimately giving me no say in it. That's the problem with the rule, is that it WAYYYYYY to strict if you take precautions to make sure your guest is safe then sure it would be okay in meeting them, that's what most people in real life do. The NBA has people in contact but they take the ultimate precautions, but I am not even given that choice.

Just because I am using the guest for my own personal reasons, IE happiness, I am not allowed to have one, it's only when you need them to make money, like when you are doing something that requires physical contact for the job, like playing basketball. The school's basically saying your mental health is not a necessity, who cares if your depressed from isolation you can't have people over that would essentially free you from isolation. They are basically stating even when the risk is 0.0000000001% of getting infected you still shouldn't take it, by banning guests in all cases that's legitimately what they are doing. 

You may think this is an over-exaggeration, which it probably is, but I just want to meet my friend in real life for the first time in 8 months, but everything in the world is forcing me not to. The world took away the little control I have in life and essentially forcing me inside with little to no option of what I consider freedom, (IE doing things with friends is freedom not like fucking going on a hike by myself type bullshit). But I can't have to do anything with friends.  

Is it really asking for much, just to have a single person you are in contact with if you yourself are basically staying in a room 24/7 eliminating all risks altogether, why can't I just do one thing risky a single thing?

&#x200B;

And please don't say I am going to kill someone from having a single guest on campus, or I should do everything possible to eliminate the risk of infecting others, there's a reason we don't all just go hide in bunkers all day for the rest of our lives, we need to take some risks that may also harm others, like driving a car.","[""Is your college doing all online classes?\n\nAre you able to travel home?

"I need advice about moving back, if I’m in the wrong for doing it.",4,ic1307,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ic1307/i_need_advice_about_moving_back_if_im_in_the/,4,"To explain some backstory:

Back in August last year, my Mom needed to caretake for two of her nieces, which required her to use my bedroom for them to sleep in. This took place 1 week after moving in for Fall 2019. Usually, after going home, I wouldn’t have my own bed or bedroom to sleep in, meaning that I would have to sleep on the couch or have limited space to get things done while school was in session.

Fast forward to March, when dorms closed due to COVID-19, it was difficult to doing anything. I still didn’t have a room, or any sort of place to keep everything organized. Classes were not fun to do, metaphorically speaking, and I was struggling for 6 months. I couldn’t study, didn’t have privacy, or in general, get things done, which caused me to suffer for the time being. The main problem being space, my physical and mental health took somewhat of a toll.

And here’s now, where we’re about 1 week left into the start of Fall. 

I’m writing this because I need advice. My parents keep asking me if this is what’s best for me. I’m still moving to Orlando since I’m stuck in a lease, and I’m honestly fine with being stuck in one. Sucks paying for my own room & bathroom, but it’s better in terms of space since I’ll have my own privacy & work area to get things done. I even went to Orlando to talk to 5 Publix stores to see if at least 1 would take me in. I did everything I can to get my life somewhat back in track, but here’s the thing.

-My parents keep telling me that going back to Orlando is a mistake, that I’ll catch the disease with higher risk, which is true.
-Being at home is easier for me, since I wouldn’t have to worry about specific things.
-That I’m being negligent for not staying home, my parents words, not mine.

One thing for sure that I know is that I have to make sure I’m on top-tier focus to making sure I follow through with getting school done.

I know my case isn’t really that important, also i don’t know if I can make this a TL;DR, but I need to figure out, in terms of morality, should I feel bad for going back to school?","[""Are you young, college aged? If so you are over 5x more likely to hospitalized by the flu than covid. \n\nIf anything you are absolutely doing the right thing. Your risk tolerance is justifiably higher than that of your parents. I'm not saying do anything stupid, but by not living in the same household as them, you don't have have to worry about getting sick and brining the illness home to your higher risk family members. This is exactly what I would tell them, and why my parents personally encouraged me to move back to college. \n\nI study philosophy. This isn't really a moral issue, and in fact highlights the problem with consequentialist moral theory and moral philosophy in general. All actions have consequences, a lot of them potentially negative. Is it immoral to drive a car because you risk getting in an accident and put others at risk of getting into an accident with you? Is it immoral to do bad at school because it will make your parents disappointed? Is it immoral to accept admission to university thereby letting one fewer people in off the waitlist? Is it immoral to go to school during flu season which is 5x more deadly for young people? At some point, the consequences of your decisions are just the price you pay for being alive and not some huge moral failure.""]",8/18/20 17:34
"Loneliness, online classes and COVID",11,ian8n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ian8n8/loneliness_online_classes_and_covid/,1,"So I’ll start off with some context. Last semester, I decided to take medical leave due to several mental health and addiction issues. It was a hard decision considering how many factors were at play, but I chose to because my grades were getting bad. In the middle of all that, COVID happened. 

Since I didn’t have the ability to screw around anymore, I began exercising, reading, and staying sober. This gave me the health and confidence I so desperately needed to return. As a result, I’m now “back” in college. 

Now, with COVID still existing, each college has different rules. My school is allowing students to live on-campus (with safety protocols in place) or off-campus. On the other hand, I’m forced to take online courses for the rest of the semester. In many ways this makes sense. My parents are concerned for my safety, and honestly I imagine that classes and events are going to be a hassle with social distancing and whatnot. But the reason I’m writing this is because I am not 100% on board with where I am.

Quarantine has been awful, especially since I haven’t had the chance to travel, get a job or see my friends. I’ve been counting down the days all summer, but now I have to wait another semester. Already seeing my friends together just makes me feel left out and sad, despite knowing the risks of being on-campus right now. Keeping my mind of self-improvement is nice, but I’ve longed to see my friends again and get back to where I was.

Is there any advice on how to cope with this kind of FOMO? I imagine others are also choosing to stay home.

TLDR; I am only taking online classes but everyone else isn’t which makes me feel left out.","['Make sure to stay in contact with them, virtually in your case, this can be done thru FaceTime, or what have you. This will probably come off as nerdy, but you can have them take you with them via FaceTime if they are the friend group to go out and do stuff, just a suggestion.\n\nI’m not in the exact same boat, but kind of. I’m at higher risk of consequences from Covid than my peers and the way I’ve been telling it to myself is this: I’d rather sit this semester/year out on the sidelines and be able to enjoy the rest of my life with friends, than for something to happen where I’d never live a normal life again.']",8/16/20 9:50
Reopening Despite the Pandemic (Your Thoughts),28,i8nb21,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i8nb21/reopening_despite_the_pandemic_your_thoughts/,35,"Hello everyone,

I recently returned to university life, despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. My university is confident that they can continue in-person classes by implementing guidelines and rules to maintain social distancing, reduce transmission rates, and maintain the virus the the instance of an outbreak. 

Despite all of the safety measures established by my university, I remain doubtful and worried about their effectiveness, especially since the university seems to be placing a lot of trust in the student body. I see students not wearing masks while being in close proximity with each other (Less than 3 feet apart). I hear that off-campus parties are still taking place. Our campus has already had 11 positive cases of the virus (though they and those who have been in close contact with them have been quarantined). I'm frustrate with those who do this and, while I remain hopeful that a serious outbreak won't happen, I'm not confident that it won't.

So I wanted to get some more perspectives on reopening during a pandemic, and whether or not it should be worrisome. I've been in conversation about this with my roommate. My roommate is confident in our university's ability to effectively prevent and contain the virus, and if there was an outbreak it shouldn't have a big impact on people our age. Even if a person dies, the chances of it happening ""are less than the chances of being struck by lightning"". My roommate believes that staying home and taking online classes will have a detrimental effect on people's mental health, and that suicide rates will go up. Those that are at risk due to medical conditions are off campus and are in isolation. I disagree with my roommate on these things. I'm not here to reinforce my opinion, but to get more perspectives on the topic and take them into account when giving my view of things. 

What are your thoughts on this? Is reopening worth the risk? Is there cause to seriously worry for people my age (18-24)? Are there other things to consider?","[""My school has a really fleshed out plan for the virus. A test 10 days before we arrive, a test as soon as we arrive, a test 10 days after we arrive. We quarantine for 2 weeks as soon as we get there, nobody leaves their rooms except for bathrooms, meals are delivered for that period. lots of strict regulations on masks, social distancing, etc, and they will not hesitate to send you home if you blatantly break these rules. We all really want to go back, but most of my friends and I agree that the safety of others is not worth being on campus if we aren't able to follow these rules. I think we have a decent chance of making it through, because we are in a small school and in the middle of nowhere, population 4000 town."", 'It pisses me off to no end that people are so careless. “It won’t affect us as much” exactly but those are the same people that go home on the weekends and visit their grandparents or go around their parents who are way more susceptible to hospitalization and death.

My roommate has left me for the fall semester,1,i82j37,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i82j37/my_roommate_has_left_me_for_the_fall_semester/,3,"So I’m scheduled to live into an apartment near my university for fall classes his Friday.

I don’t party or see other people out side of my family and I’m not interested in not social distancing if I were to move in to an apartment.

If you have a recommendation of another sub I could post on that would be great. 

I've had a rough time dealing with COVID mentally and the environment I was in played a very big part in that. I thought I had my college future all set up as I had just graduated from a local community college with my AA, focusing in Psych. I was planning to transfer to a local four year and live on campus. I busted my ass for two years to get to that point, working full time and going to school full time but I thought it would all be worth it once I got to University. Then COVID hits and now school is up in the air for the fall semester which just absolutely crushed me. I was so excited to finally get to a four year university... I'd make all these friends, join all these clubs, etc. It would have allowed me to break out of my shell and become more social. So yeah big blow to my mental health since I thought I would be escaping my current living situation and now I'm not. I have since decided to move to Texas and live with my dad in hopes my living situation will be better. Now that I have that all sorted out, I have to worry about school and my future there. I've been researching options for the last week or so. Just keep in mind, my end goal is to get as far as possible in my education with as little debt as possible (tough to do in the USA). 

1. Attend an online four year university from Texas. I've been looking at ASU online and have found a couple degrees there I would be interested in. I would like to talk to some people who have done online college like that, preferably even went to ASU or another one like it in the US. This would be rather expensive in my opinion though as you pay out of state tuition so it's like almost 20k/year for an online school. I don't know my FAFSA situation since I've been collecting unemployment during the pandemic and I'm unsure how that affects my end of the year taxes. 
2. Move somewhere out of country and get my degree abroad. I was thinking somewhere like the University of Iceland... the college tuition would be free but you have to pay yearly for student permit which is about $600 USD. So college is a lot cheaper but I would have to pay for myself to live there; average cost of living is about $1400 USD/ month. I believe you can also only work 15 hours with that student permit, which is nice but also limits your income. I don't know what wages are like out there, haven't checked yet. 
3. Wait to become a Texas resident (12 months from semester start date). If my math is right, I would have to wait 18 months to go back to school in this option. I'm afraid to do this because what if I lose my edge or study habits? Even a Community college will charge me out of state tuition so I don't think I'd do that either in those 18 months. College would be much cheaper though and in 18 months we would hopefully have COVID solved so it would be in person schooling too. 

Any advice or info you could provide on any of this would be great. I'm just having a hard time sorting it all out in my head and I can't really talk to my mom since she'll go nuts that I'm looking at schools in Iceland. 

TL;DR College kid in US weighing college options mid-COVID; Go online, move to Icecland or wait 18 months to become a Texas resident.","[""there is no guarantee that the situation is different in other countries, this covid thing will be around for quite some time, so I wouldn't go abroad just yet, why move just to end up taking online classes over there?""]",8/3/20 3:37
Backup plans (especially in the times of covid) are necessary,44,i1uqqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i1uqqd/backup_plans_especially_in_the_times_of_covid_are/,0,"I am a 2020 University graduate with a BSBA (majored in finance and minored in economics. When I was a junior and a first semester senior I was still struggling to find an internship as I could never find one that would work with my schedule, even though I had a 3.94 gpa. 

I did get one for early this year at a financial advising firm. I was very grateful for that opportunity and did my best working there. But in late March and early April when covid hit the U.S. pretty bad things quickly tuned other ways. I got a call on my day off that my internship ended, which was already planned to turn to a full-time role post-graduation. After that point it’s been a real struggle in searching for decent or good full-time roles in my area. I applied to hundreds of positions and had interviews, but nothing stuck out that much and I only got a handful of offers, where most weren’t good. So I’ve continued to apply for roles up until a few weeks ago, with little results.

But, I had a backup plan, which has saved this coming year. Even though many people, including students, professors, and people I asked for advice from online told me that it wasn’t the best move, I applied for an MBA at the University I did my undergrad at. I did it totally as a backup plan in case job prospects completely fell through and I couldn’t find anything else, just like what happened. The University has over this summer helped me find an internship in an analytics department at a large healthcare company in the area. 

This internship A. pays me more than the full-time role I would have had B. pays me plenty to live and pay towards the loans I’ll get for the program C. gives me a foot in the door for one of the largest and highest paying companies in my area D. helps me to accomplish a goal of getting my MBA E. helps with my mental health as I will still have great goals for this coming year, while covid is going to continue making life both weird and difficult.

Having this backup plan only cost me $500 for a deposit towards the program and $250 to take the GMAT to be able to get into the program. Yes, this isn’t cheap to do as a backup plan, but compared to the benefits I’ll get from this coming year, this was a worthwhile investment.

I wanted to post about this because I think especially in these weird times it’s important to not expect everything to work out in your favor. Not all backup plans cost money either, you could have a backup class schedule in case a class falls through or any number of other things. We should always hope our goals and wants come to fruition, but having backup plans especially around something as important as college can help save us when they don’t.",[],8/1/20 20:13
Am I making the wrong decision to go on campus?,45,hwd13a,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hwd13a/am_i_making_the_wrong_decision_to_go_on_campus/,17,"I’m an incoming freshman and I decided that I’d go on campus instead of doing online classes from home, however, I keep having second thoughts and keep flipping back and forth on decisions. These are the thoughts that keep influencing my decision:

- My financial aid covers tuition + room & board so it’s not like I’m actually paying for much if I do choose to go.

- I’d be going from northeast state that’s doing pretty well to a school in Texas which isn’t doing too hot right now in terms of managing Covid.

- I’d be more inclined to stay home if a bunch of incoming freshmen also chose to stay home but from recent polls it seems like almost 80% of incoming freshman are opting to go on campus. Even though socialization is going to be severely limited, I feel like I’d be “behind” on making friends and getting a social life, especially as a person who’s generally introverted and somewhat socially anxious.

- If schools end up closing midway through the semester, I’d have to scramble to find a way back home across half the country while trying to keep up with school.

- My situation at home isn’t necessarily bad and I’m grateful to have a relatively supportive family, but it’s also not the best and I’ve definitely felt my mental state deteriorating these past few months and I’m not sure if it’d be good for my mental health continue living at home in a cramped room/house that’s smaller than what my dorm room would be. 

- Even though I’d be doing almost entirely online classes if I do go on campus, I feel like at least being in a “school-like” environment would motivate me to keep up with schoolwork and I can talk to my roommate or anybody else nearby when at home, I wouldn’t really be able to even have a conversation with anyone about school stuff. Doing online classes at home in my small bedroom seems way worse to me than doing online classes in a dorm room.

- My college is relatively small, is committed to testing the student population, and I’d be taking as many precautions as I can myself but of course I can’t control what other people do and some people are probably bound to break covid rules and regulations which could create outbreaks on campus.

- Even though Texas is doing bad right now, they could end up turning it around in a month or two, and I could end up regretting my decision.

- And of course, there’s also my own fear of catching covid. If I do end up getting it, I’m afraid of how I’d be able to really take care of myself and do online classes without any care from parents or other family. But then again, I’m not covid-free at home either as I could just as easily catch it from my own family members who has to go to work every day or if I go outside myself. Going to college would at least give me some peace of mind that I wasn’t the cause for my family getting covid.

Sorry if this post seems all over the place, I just wanted to get my thoughts about this out. I’ve been having a hard time deciding and I have to make this decision soon and I’m just not sure what to do and would like some clarity and advice on the situation.","[""Dude. There are no good answers here unfortunately. See if your school has a policy in place for another shutdown, if they will be allowing students to stay in the dorms under a semi- quarantine, worst case scenario. **There's not a lot of information about the long term health issues from this pandemic, but what we have learned IS NOT GOOD** If you have any underlying health conditions, or would have to fly home to stay with family members with health conditions it's not a good idea. I hate online schooling and socializing is not easy for me so I understand your low desire for being there in person, no judgments. I do however think that the idea of things opening up/getting better in a few months is unreasonable and not realistic so try to plan accordingly. While you're home, try to bunker down in your room alone if you need time away from the fam, use headphones and keep a notebook with you and say you're doing a freshman orientation, new distance learning recommendation seminar, intro to new free mini courses, etc whatever you need to do to get time to yourself and watch Shrek or whatever it is you kids like these days"", ""I just want to add one thing that I don't think the other comments addressed yet. You are not behind. This is happening to everyone, and we all have to adapt. It sucks bad. I just don't want you to feel bad because you weren't where you wanted to be socially, academically, or whatever. This is the hand everyone was dealt. Don't compare yourself to what you thought things would be like too much. It just isn't healthy."", ""You have to dip what's best for you and stick to your decision; it's a common and agile thing to do. There is no right answer, unfortunately."", 'Just want to say either decision makes sense.

I would encourage you to seek out more information about what life on campus will look like this fall. \n\nMy institution is requiring masks in all campus buildings, students must sit six feet apart in assigned seats during class (no food/drink, no group work, no in class activities), student organizations cannot hold meetings with more than 10-12 students in the same space, many of our traditional welcome activities have been canceled/moved to a virtual format, etc. IMO, that doesn\'t sound very fun.\n\nSee if you can get an idea for what campus life is going to be like this fall and decide whether you are OK with that experience for your first semester of college or if you would be better off staying home.

Lots of freshmen are in the same boat right now, so you\'re not alone.', ""See if your university has any provisions for letting certain people stay on campus, even if a shutdown does happen. Last spring when my school shut down and kicked everyone out of the dorms, you could appeal to Residence Life and Housing if you had special circumstances where it would be safer for you to stay. If you wouldn't be able to travel home in a very short span of time, or if your family would be unreasonably put at risk by your return, you may be able to remain in the dorms.

How to mentally prepare for Spring 2021 to also be online?,30,hu810b,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hu810b/how_to_mentally_prepare_for_spring_2021_to_also/,25,"Guys, I'm going to be so devastated if/when Spring 2021 ends up also being online. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised at all if things were still in lock down mode. How do you guys deal with this? 

I was depressed in my old high school and had almost zero social skills (bullying got so bad that I shut down socially and I thought everyone made fun of me). It was such a traumatic experience that I still get anxiety with the mere mention of the name of my high school. 

Going to college was such a life changer and possibly even a life saver. Everything about the college life was leagues better, classes that actually mattered, a better future that you were actively working towards and not having to deal with all the assholes from high school.

I ended up going to a CC for 3 years where I slowly built myself back up again to a normal person through persistence from going out of my comfort bubble and talking to people. It was really hard at first but I was able to ease myself out of the state I was in coming out of high school (Public Speaking was a nightmare at first but it really helped me to be confident when talking to people). 

Everything just clicked and worked. Getting a 3.6 GPA from being passionate about my classes, forming friendships with great people I would have never even met, had I not gone out of my way to talk to, even befriending old high school classmates I thought had made fun of me. I thought I would hate going to a local CC at first because of the stigma against it (I know, it was dumb for me to think it) but I ended up loving each and every single semester there, and I wouldn't trade anything for those memories. I'm kind of sad that I wasn't able to fully experience my last semester there on campus but it is what it is.

But at the end of the day, it was still a CC and I was really excited for the actual college experience. I'm transferring to a CSU this Fall for the last 2 years of my major and I planned on making the most of it.Taking the next step socially and joining and participating in a club, going to the college gym with my high school friend, and getting an on campus job. Overall trying to cram the last 2 ""free"" years of my life before having to work a 9-5 job the rest of adulthood.

The news that Fall 2020 would be online just crushed me, taking online classes through Zoom was mind numbingly boring last semester and I can't imagine going through 4 more months of it. It's almost as if my mental health developed a crutch on going to college, it's probably the quarantine speaking, but I feel like I'm regressing back to my high school days without being able to go outside. I thought my time at the CC helped me deal with HS trauma but quarantine is digging it back up where I just buried it instead of dealing with it.  I can't even go back to my job that I love because my Covid-prone parents. Not a day now goes by in lock down that I don't think these thoughts. I missed out on so much in my early years of life in high school like going to parties, getting a girlfriend, dancing at prom (just being a normal person) that I'm afraid it will happen AGAIN in college. If Spring 2021 also ends up being online, it will mean I'll only have a single year to cram what I missed out on the past 7 years. I only have a year of finding a girlfriend for the 1st time, if I miss out on it, I might not be able to ever find one later on. I genuinely think that if I miss out on something as big a milestone as college life, I would develop a lot regret about it later in life. Regret that would just eat my happiness and turn me bitter. It's just the type of person I am, I'm already worried about the future soul crushing cubicle job I'm going to have to deal with just like my Dad. I'm scared of working a 9-5 job that will make time pass by faster like nothing else. Every adult talks about it, blinking once and seeing your kid turn from a toddler into a college student just like yourself 20-30 years ago, blinking twice and seeing yourself turn into an old man wondering where all those years went. What makes it worse is most of every adult I know makes it seem like they had a fun early adult life, actually getting to experience the joys of being young. My mindset feels incredibly selfish considering many people work their entire lives and can't go to college but I just can't stop thinking about it. I don't want my life to amount to nothing at the end. opportunities and privileges wasted to a guy too lazy to use it.","['You probably don\'t want to hear this but you\'re putting college on a pedestal and treating it like the end all be all of your time to grow and experience new things.

Considering going back to college in Miami,6,hu98sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hu98sy/considering_going_back_to_college_in_miami/,4,"I go to the University of Miami, which for me as a Mass resident, looks like peak Wuhan. I’ve weighed out the pros and cons, and for me I would ideally like to go to campus because I’m an architecture student and my 3 hr studios every day are best done in person. Online was ok, but honestly it was too easy and I felt like I wasn’t learning as much. Additionally I’m going to be living in a dorm, and going now guarantees my spot for spring. 

Now there are a lot of cons. I’ll be living in a double with one of my best friends and Miami is so bad for Corona right now. Going back I have to accept that I have a good chance of getting it. I’ve been doing research non stop these past few days on how it affects college aged kids. I’m not at risk, I consider myself a pretty healthy person. I know that there is still a chance for me to be severely affected but it’s pretty low. What really worries me is the long term effects. More and more reports are coming out that there could be possible long term effects, but the exact percentages and ages affected aren’t clear. There’s definitely temporary lung scarring even for asymptomatic cases, but if anyone has more data on the likelihood of someone of my age (19) getting long term effects I would really appreciate if you shared it.

A scenario I’ve been running through my head is: I go to campus and stay as safe as possible, when the cases inevitably rise on campus and they’re forced to stop in person classes I can come back, but I have my spot secured for the spring. This itself is pretty risky but again, it all depends on the severity of the virus. I don’t want to risk my long term health for some short term fun. I can’t tell in the long term effects and rare young covid deaths have been overblown by the media or not. 

The last thing is, it’s a matter of mental health vs. physical health for me. Being here and watching my friends go to Miami and continue to build their relationships is going to be tough. I’m already sick of being away from college, being here longer is going to suck. If anyone else is in a similar scenario or wants to chime in please do so.

Edit: Was considering posting something like this to r/coronavirus but I would probably get told that it’s inevitable death so I’m looking for a more rational answer.","['[deleted]', ""I hate to say it, but even with the studies, we don't know all the long term effects that can happen outside of damaging lungs and severe vein and blood issues after recovery. It's a risk everyone's taking, but the good news is that the longer it's around, the more we'll know in long term effects. I'm big for staying home, but if you might need housing in the spring, it's smarter to go and be safe about what you can control. Take safety precautions to avoid catching it, like using a face mask, avoiding crowded areas, having hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, and set ground rules for your roommate to follow similar safety precautions to protect the both of you. Because if one of you catches it, you'll both be in quarantine and suffer the effects of being in quarantine. I wouldn't say it's certain death, but if you're smart and can manage following rules, I think you'll have a far lower risk of catching it. Not impossible, but low, and the need for housing in the spring probably outweighs almost everything else.""]",7/20/20 2:08

* There's too many people working inside of my home at the same time so there's a lot of conflict in the home-- sound carries way too much and we all have different schedules like for food and things (it's already happening with my dad working and me working at the same time, so then we will be adding my brother into the mix)
* It would be hard if things took a turn for the worse in regards to COVID and I need to move back home but there is a lease. Also rent is expensive where I would move (closer to my college)
* My parents moved after I graduated high school so I don't have friends in the town I am currently living in, which would make it difficult to escape always being in my house
* I just really need space
* The constant maintenance of an apartment while taking fully online classes is a lot because you will be in your apartment more than you normally would otherwise
* Although my mental health has been doing too hot, the idea of me moving into an apartment has been really stressing out my parents.

There's a chance nothing could happen and get worse, but there's also the chance that you're stuck there and have to self-quarantine when you return home if you're able to get home. The biggest risk you're taking is being stuck in an apartment in that city because of restrictions, and the lowest risk is doing classes online and being in a somewhat state of normalcy. \n\nIt sounds like your worst problems(outside of not really knowing anyone) is noise and conflict. You can find soundproofing panels on Amazon, and put a few against your door to help and on other hot areas if your family agrees to it. You should all probably lay out some ground rules for whatever you're already fighting over and come to some understanding to make living there more tolerable for everyone. My dad's an early eater (think like 5:15 or so) and I don't like to eat until after six. So, we compromise with leftovers for dinner or a time like 5:30-5:40 so we eat as a family.

Should I risk living-on campus or stay in my toxic home environment? (Fall 2020),7,hhryn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hhryn1/should_i_risk_livingon_campus_or_stay_in_my_toxic/,7,"So, this is a very last minute decision I have to make. Specifically, I have to decide by tomorrow afternoon. I'm very split on this decision, as both options have serious effects.

We have to pick our housing for the 2020-2021 school year, and naturally this pandemic has made things a lot more difficult. For transparency, while I may be young (19F), I have multiple medical conditions- but the one most notable is that I am a diabetic. This, correct me if I'm wrong, puts me at more risk of serious complications if I do contract COVID-19. While the university will be implementing measures to help prevent or decrease spreading, my father is still very much opposed to me living on-campus this year, especially now that cases are ramping back up again. They could also possibly cut hours of operation or even shut down dining options, which is a serious risk as a Type 1 Diabetic. I was already struggling a little bit managing with the hours they had before.

My home environment is pretty toxic, miserable and overall detrimental to my mental health. I struggle with mental illness (namely severe depression and anxiety), as well as untreated ADD. Currently, I can't get mental help or help with my ADD while at home for reasons I won't get into here. As such, my mental health and ADD symptoms are only made a lot worse when I'm at home. This was shown to have a big impact on my academics (since Spring term was online from home), where I barely managed to pass a couple of my classes when before I was a B average. To those hoping I could just get an apartment and move away from both, that isn't an option. It's either staying at home or living on-campus. (To make it clear, my mom is worried, but she is still understanding and supportive of whatever choice I make. My dad is the one who's always been a controlling and suffocating helicopter parent.)

Another thing that keeps me unsure is how freaking expensive housing is. If I stay home, I can be saving $2k-$3k from this term alone, which would likely mean me breaking even with paying for college this year rather than oweing all this money upfront at the start of the school year.

If I do pick a dorm just to be safe, and later decide to live at-home instead, there is possibly a $450 cancellation fee. If I don't pick a dorm at all, and changes are made so all classes are in-person again, I'm most likely fucked because of commuting restraints. (I live in a different city in a rural area and can't afford that much gas.)

**TL;DR** \- I love living on-campus, it's a great break from home, I love the library and all the resources, I have a chance to make and spend time with friends rather than being isolated at home, and my improved mental health there keeps my grades up. But there is the risk of COVID, possibly less access to food which I need as a Type 1 Diabetic, and possibly paying a lot out of pocket once summer ends.

If I stay home I likely won't have to pay out of pocket, I have very low risk of catching COVID, and access to food that I need at all hours.

Should I live on-campus or stay at home?

the conflict of fall 2020 and the coronavirus,8,hft24g,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hft24g/the_conflict_of_fall_2020_and_the_coronavirus/,0,"I am somewhat cynical over the ways fall 2020 will be conducted in our education system. 

First of all, I know how much of a mental toll this quarantine has been for everyone. It has been hell for all of us. Looking into the future, I am worried colleges and schools for younger children will be breeding grounds for the spread of the virus. Even in the current condition where everyone is expected to wear masks and social distance, there have been widespread and soaring cases of COVID. Children and college-aged students in our schools cannot be expected to stay 6 feet away from each other. It's physically and socially impossible. Social contact is expected, and this will increase the rates of COVID in our communities. Students do not want to take online classes.  

Of course, the opposing argument is schools from pre-k to college have to successfully open. We cannot stall the education of young people, the future generation. A long quarantine is not good either for the depressed economy. If the education system is stalled and we are forced to do online classes, then the economy will suffer. People working in education directly or indirectly will lose their paychecks. There will be less socialization, and everyone knows college students love to party, have fun, and be crazy. Without a promise of in-person classes, many will take a gap year. 

Obviously, we live in unprecedented times. Even public health experts cannot accurately predict the future. What will fall 2020 look like? How many empty promises can colleges set forth? I doubt most colleges can literally keep students 6 feet apart. Only time can tell what will happen...",[],6/26/20 0:03
What to do if taking a Leave of Absence this Fall?,4,hevp3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hevp3d/what_to_do_if_taking_a_leave_of_absence_this_fall/,9,"Obviously with covid and the entire nature of college life being altered, many students are considering taking leaves of absences this fall. I was certain I’d be going back to campus but my school just announced more detailed plans for the Fall and, like most other schools, it does not look like it’s gonna be anywhere close to normal (reduced housing capacity, strict rules for social gatherings, large classes held online, etc)  

I’ve been pretty miserable at home (my parents moved after I started college, so currently living in a state/city where I know nobody, times aren’t ideal for meeting new people too) so really want to get back to campus but I attend a very expensive private university and just don’t know that I can justify the cost if most classes will still be online. 

So for those you knowing that you want to take a leave of absence this fall what are your plans?

The idea of a traveling gap semester now is something I’d love to do, but can’t really travel internationally now. Do people have any rural/domestic places they’ll be traveling to?

The simplest thing I can think to do is get a job and stay with my parents, but like I said I’m really not enjoying being home and worried how staying here for another 6 months would be on my mental health. 

Basically just looking for some ideas to help me make this decision, so we please share what you are doing (or would do!)!!","['Please don’t travel unnecessarily during a pandemic, domestic or international. \n\nLeaves of absence are policy issues that will depend on your school.

I live a few hours away from the small, private university that I go to, and right now my parents are highly against me going back to campus in the fall. My school is offering the option to go remote for those that are uncomfortable coming back to campus, or you can come back to campus and take socially distanced, hybrid classes. I was supposed to live on campus in the upperclassmen dorms next year, but because they are splitting up a lot of the freshman class and need more room, they are moving us into nearby luxury apartments for the same price as a school dorm. My classes are also all seminar based, and I have the perfect schedule for in person classes. On the other side, I would be saving about $5k if I stayed home (at the expense of my mental health lol) and of course, I would be considerably more safe from COVID.

Studying wasn't as easy anymore, there's no backtracking in the exams and exams had much shorter times to be completed. On top of that, I had to live alone by myself during the quarantine which worsened my mental health and the day right before my final exam, my brother, who is a doctor, was hospitalized and was suspected as having COVID-19.

Worried about my dorm room,12,hdmfom,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hdmfom/worried_about_my_dorm_room/,10,"Hey everyone, I'm experiencing a lot of worry about my dorm room and its comfort. I'm going to be a sophomore and I love my college, the physical dorm building (although I haven't lived there I got my top pick) and I love my roommate. 

My college tentatively announced that we are going to have to wear masks anytime not in our dorm and have to reserve tables to go get food and all these other restrictions. I honestly spent the majority of my time in my room freshman year anyway due to depression, lol. But now that I have all these factors motivating/requiring me to spend a lot of time in my room, I'm really worried about liking the space I'm in.

My specific worries are:

1. If I'm going to be studying in my room, how can I make my workspace pleasant and conducive to learning?
2. I didn't do homework in my room except for a few times during my freshman year because I didn't want to associate my room with stress. I mostly did it in the dining hall or library, but it doesn't look like those are viable options. How can I separate the stress of working at my desk from the rest of the room?
3. I want to make the executive decision that I will only go into my bed to sleep, so for that to work I want to put a small table and chairs that aren't my desk/desk chair in front of my tv. I would normally just go to the lounge area of my dorm but COVID. Is this silly? Does anyone have any better ideas of comfortable spaces to exist in my room beside my bed or desk? 
4. What's the best way to not get bored with my room? I'm thinking of putting something eye-catching or something that I love on the walls and asking my roommate if she wants to do the same. 
5. What is the most comfortable mask y'all have found? Looks like I'm going to be wearing a mask upwards of 6 hours a day every day that I have class and IDK how much on weekends.
6. Final question, thank you if you read this far, what are good foods to have in our mini-fridge that are healthy but don't take up a ton of space or spoil quickly? This is honestly one of my bigger worries. I don't think I'll want to eat at the dining hall and not take a break between sections of classes mask-wise, so I think I'll want to have some meals in my room. I'm worried about expanding this to more than Kraft mac and cheese etc. 

Ugh!!! I can't stop thinking about all of these things and worrying about my mental health crashing and burning or my work being poor because I can't separate TV time from work time. If you have suggestions for one or two I'd be grateful, no need to answer all 6 lol! Thank you if you read this far I hope this makes sense!!!","['When working at your desk, put your phone in a drawer. Don’t even have it in eye sight. I always get distracted when I’m trying to study and my phone is right next to me. Also I’m not sure how big your room is, but you could totally get a chair to relax in while watching tv. For wall decorations I would say just go wild with whatever you want. I hate staring at blank walls so I always put up a bunch of posters and my artwork. As for food, my go to is apples and carrots', ""Hi there! I'm entering my second senior year this fall. College has been a hell of a ride and I loved every second of it, even the hard parts, and I'm glad I'm taking another year. I hope you enjoy your time there too! I never studied in my dorm if I could help it, but I have read up on some other strategies. These things helped me study in my own room back home when I was booted out of my dorm thanks to the 'rona, so hopefully they'll be helpful to you too.\n\n\n\n-If your dorm is big enough, do your best to keep your work space separate from your sleeping one. Make a barrier with furniture or curtains if you can. I'm not sure what your ceiling is like, but if it's made of those crumbly porous tiles, you can slip a curtain under the tile and use a few large binder clips to pin it between the ceiling tiles and the grid they rest on. Easy privacy! A few colorful string/fairy lights and you've got a sweet little corner. If the ceiling isn't like that, get some heavy duty command hooks, stick them on the walls up high, and tie a strong line between them. You can drape the curtains that way, again using binder clips. Tension rods work too. \n\n\n-Make sure your work space is pleasant, but not distracting. Redbubble has a TON of tapestries with vastly different designs, and the Honey app will find the best coupons for discounts. I have one of a stag made of blue and red stardust that I never get tired of looking at. It's bright, colorful, and helps me when I need to zone out for a sec without being too distracted. As I mentioned before, fairy lights would also help brighten it up.\n\n\n-For your study space, try to get a spot with some nice natural light. Doesn't have to be right next to a window, but if you can at least catch some rays, it helps your mood more than you might think! \n\n\n-Never bring your phone into your work space. Just leave it in your fun space. Use your computer for music instead of your phone, and absolutely do NOT open social media on your laptop. Gotta keep those associations separate! But if you really do need to have it around for timers or anything, the Forest app is a nice way to keep distracting temptations at bay.\n\n\n-Know that your study habits and methods likely won't be the same as they were last year. With such a massive upheaval of everything, it's no shocker. Please don't be angry at yourself if you find that things are harder than before - they are, and it's not your fault. You can and will adapt, you just need time!\n\n\n-When things get difficult, treat yourself gently and with compassion, as you would a ladybug or dragonfly that landed on your shoulder to rest. Get a snack, drink some water, take the break you need, and get back to it when you're feeling better. :)\n\n\n-Speaking of snacks, popcorn is a good one. Some butter, brown sugar, and vanilla melted in the microwave is the absolute best topping, and butter keeps in the fridge for a long time! \n\n-Saltines and butter is also very good. \n\n-Saltines and peanut butter\n\n-Graham crackers\n\n-Chocolate teddy grahams (yes, I'm a child)\n\n-Frozen fruit! Pour some milk over it, a little sugar, wait 5 mins, and you've got poor man's ice cream!\n\n-Twizzlers. GREAT study snack!\n\n\n-I don't know if you have access to a kitchen, but if you do, take an hour or so to make a fat stack of peanut butter/chocolate/banana/protein powder pancakes. Kept in Tupperware, they'll last about 5 days before they start to get dry and they're SO filling and delicious, and good to grab in the morning on the way to class!\n\nI will update this list of snacks when I can think of some more.\n\n\n-As far as masks go, my Dad found a really great store on Etsy that makes very comfortable ones. They're not the super high-grade ones, but they're a lot better than nothing and they're well-made. I'll ask him about it and share the link as soon as I can.\n\n\n\nI'll add more tips when I think of them; these are just off the top of my head. Sounds like you've got a lot going for you at school! Liking your roommate is a real blessing! And a big part of college is taking on challenges like this one and working through them, and I have no doubt you're more than capable of that!\n\nEdit: formatting, I'm on mobile"", '1. Put away distractions: toss your phone in the drawer, instrumental music to “isolate” yourself to some extent.\n\n5. I have a cycling mask I used to wear when in the city so I don’t have to inhale all the dust tossed up on a dry day, but if all you have are the disposable ear loop masks you can try and see if you could get a tpu 3d printer holder if you have an engineering lab with a printer in your campus.\n\n6. Peanut butter, oats (bulk since individual servings with flavors have more sugars than you think), and other things. It mostly depends on when do you actually foresee yourself (or your roommate) eating certain foods. Like within a span of how much time and any planned grocery days?', ""Definitely make use of your side of the room. Lofting your bed (if your school lets you!) can maximize your space to create a sort of relax zone for your TV under your bed. Tapestries, though cliche college room decor, make for easy wall decorations. I have one that's a mountain scene that reminds me of my grandparents' home. For your desk, keep it as minimal and clean as possible when you're studying to prevent distractions. It might take a few weeks, but soon enough it will become part of your routine that your brain will recognize that desk means study.\n\nFor masks, I recommend a mask made of 2 or more layers of cotton if you don't have access to medical masks. Cotton is a breathable fabric, and I'm sure there are plenty of tutorials online to make your own if you can't find any online or what have you.\n\nThis year will be different, but you've totally got this!"", '1.  I had a lofted bed with my desk underneath. I hung a tapestry over it so it separated it from the rest of the room. Turn everything off except music and put your phone away. Use headphones and only keep school stuff on your desk. Also make a calendar, an assignment list, and an ongoing task list in that area. That’s what helped me in the dorms and in life lmao \n\n\n2.  Same as 1 essentially. If you can’t lift your bed see if you can get a divider or something or set up futons and other furniture to really make a separate space. Don’t use that space for anything besides school work. Even if you’re taking a short break get up and walk to another part of the room. \n\n\n3.  Same as 1 and 2 essentially but for the TV haha! If you don’t have a roommate use the other half of the room as your chill space. If you can lift your bed no issue. If you can’t and you can’t use a separator, put your futon facing the TV and your TV opposite your work and sleep space. That’s what I would do personally. Or just use your will power to turn the tv off before bed and be willing to move furniture or migrate. \n\n\n4.  Fun decorations are a good idea. Otherwise just having activities. Get into running and walking. Get into yoga. Make your roommate play board games with you. You just have to keep busy. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and I’m bored of it already bc of this quarantine. I think it’s kind of inevitable. Get decorations you can move around and change. Paint. Keep plants so you have something that grows and that you can take care of. \n\n\n5.  Homemade have been the best for me. My mom made me two and I feel so spoiled. She used sports bras and hair ties. I’ll try finding the sewing pattern. Otherwise a lot of stores are selling them. I’d recommend looking for one with a pocket you can shove a coffee filter into for extra filtration. \n\n\n6.  Ramen noodles (Costco sells a super nice and big rice ramen noodle bag... not sure if it’s microwaveable though but if not nbd regular ramen is fine) and frozen vegetables. Cheese. Applesauce packets. Dried fruits. Jar of pickles maybe?? Bulky but whatever. Those instant oatmeal or egg things maybe??\n\n\nExtra: are classes mandatory in person?? If not I would recommend just not going to school for the semester or something... my heart goes out to you. You’re missing out on so much of the college experience this sucks. Best of luck to you this semester. Kick ass stay healthy. Sending good vibes your way :)))', 'i don’t have great answers for a lot of your questions because i didn’t live in a dorm, but: \n5. get a mask from etsy. i’ve been loving linen ones because they’re super breathable. i can’t send links if you’re interested.\n6. i would just avoid filling it with condiments! that is a major space eater in a lot of college fridges. fill it with leftovers, salad materials, and snacks like cheese and fruit instead. also i would get a kettle!!! you can use it for instant coffee, tea, and ramen without leaving your room!', 'Thank you all so much!

Deferring college due to medical/mental health issues — advice?,3,h7t2ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/h7t2ep/deferring_college_due_to_medicalmental_health/,4,"Hi everybody, this is my first post here so I hope I’m doing it correctly. I’m looking for a bit of advice on deferring the first year of college this fall. 

A bit of background: since quarantine started, my mental health has significantly deteriorated for a number of reasons (not related to quarantine, but it began around that time). On top of that, I was diagnosed last month with a chronic illness that has also taken a toll on my mental health. With college starting just 3 months away, I have been seriously considering deferring as I’m not in the right place to upend my life here and deal with the stressors that come with starting college. I feel very insecure and depressed and it would probably be a bad idea to move away from home with all of that happening. 

We’ve called the college I’m supposed to attend,  and they were very nice and open about it. They said that they suggest I wait to make a final decision until we know what their plan is for this fall due to the virus, but they will allow me to defer at any time due to medical issues. 

The thing is, I feel bad about deferring and just staying home. I’m wondering what I’ll be able to do because of Covid-19. I really don’t want to just lounge around while all my friends are starting school, and I would prefer to actually work or do something to keep me busy.

Did I ruin my chances at getting into grad school/having a good career after college?,6,gt5ezo,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gt5ezo/did_i_ruin_my_chances_at_getting_into_grad/,1,"I’m a college senior in my fifth year, double majoring in both biology and psychology. I started off as just a psych major but I wasn’t sure what i wanted to do with that degree. It wasn’t until my fourth year (so fall 2018), after taking a bio class, that I decided to add biology as a second major. I knew since then that I wanted to get a degree afterwards in healthcare (the exact career kept changing all the time, like i went from wanting to be a PA, to a Nurse practitioner, to an optometrist, and now a genetic counselor). However, during most of my time in college, I haven’t taken advantage of extra curricular opportunities because I’ve largely struggled with my mental health for a few years now (namely depression and social anxiety), and so I don’t really have volunteer hours or have participated in clubs, etc. I still have one and a half years left until I finish my bio degree (I’m basically already done with my psych one), and earlier this year I wanted to join more clubs, be more active in class, and so on. I started seeing a therapist at school too. But then the whole COVID-19 situation kind of put a hamper on some those efforts. 

Now I’m trying to volunteer in different ways, and join a research lab, try to join a club in the fall, and so on. But I’m so worried and anxious about the future because I only have a year and a half left and there’s only so much I can do. Moreover, I won’t get accepted into any grad programs I apply to later on. 

So did I basically ruin my shot at grad school/a good career by not taking care of mental health earlier, and then participating in more extra-curricular experience? I’m planning on taking a gap year too to get more experience/volunteer hours in, but I’m worried even then that I won’t get accepted.

I originally moved in the area to be close to the college and my work study job but now that everything has moved online, I am starting to question if this is really what I want in life or if spending time in college to earn a degree is worth it because of the recession that is going to take place.

However, i turned them down bc my parents said they'll pay for everything and that i can take my time (despite not being financially that well off). I was thankful, but I was persistent of enlisting bc I knew college was expensive and that It will probably take me more than 4/5 yrs to figure out what I wanna do. I could also esrn some money, get some skills and benefits, etc. The thing is that they dismessed my perspective bc i was young and dumb and didnt know what I was talking about. Lowkey also got into a bad arguement over whether to enlist or go to college.

So i gave into their pressure. We're still not doing well financially, especially with COVID 19.

I'm not completely ridden with fear over this, since I've been taking 15 credits this semester and it's actually been super manageable for me (even during the COVID situation, I'm still getting straight As and keeping up my 4.0), but I'm worried about my mental health during the summer and next couple of semesters, even my guidance counselor wanted me to be mindful of burnout and to pay attention to my mental health during this intensive schedule. I'm also going to have to study for and take the SAT/ACT over this summer as I never took them, so it's going to be a busy year for sure.

Why don’t I care about my failing grades?,8,fwr01s,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fwr01s/why_dont_i_care_about_my_failing_grades/,5,"I’ve experienced this sort of apathy for a long time.  After about my freshman year of high school, I pretty much scraped through to get a good scholarship because of my high standardized test scores and decent gpa.  Once I actually made it to college, I experienced some pretty severe depression and apathy.  

For the first 2 years of college I only earned 12 credit hours, from my first semester of my freshman year.  I managed to earn 6 more during a summer intercession. I had to withdraw from all other semesters, once because of a mental health crisis, then because I had to get a restraining order against an abusive ex, and the other because I would’ve failed everything otherwise.  

This semester, again, I withdrew from everything  except 2 classes.  I’m trying to stick with it; my school has gone pass/fail so I should manage to scrape by.  For my whole college experience, I have felt like more of an outside observer than an actual participant, even though I’m actually enrolled in classes.   It doesn’t feel real and like a priority to me somehow.  It doesn’t seem to matter very much at all.  If I can get these 6 credit hours, I will officially be a junior.  (I had a full year of credits coming to college.  AP classes, dual enrollment, etc). 

I did try to get involved my freshman year- joined a sorority, did the honors program, all that.  I just didn’t make friends or have fun.  I dropped that stuff after my first year.  Things have gotten a lot better for me socially since then, and I’ve made some good friends that go to my school.  But still I pretty much let this semester pass my by like all the rest- even before COVID-19 blew everything up.  I skipped classes and missed assignments, and just constantly felt one step behind.  I can never seem to stay on top of anything.  My dad has suggested that I may have some ADD issues, which he suffers from as well, but I have been evaluated by a couple psychiatrists who didn’t seem to think so.  How can I change my last year of college to not be like the rest?  My GPA is not beyond repair; I’m sitting at a 2.9.  I don’t know exactly what I want out of my future but I know I probably need a degree.  I’d like to keep a good enough GPA to keep the option of grad school open for me later should I want to go.  I have a lot of varied interests... sort of a Jack of all trades, master of none.  It makes me feel so indecisive, and I’ll go through phases of being extra-passionate toward one thing, and think I’ll want to commit to a path leading toward that goal, but then that passion eventually burns out, until it pops back up on my radar later- or maybe not at all.

I'm ready to get back on campus, but if that doesn't happen in the fall, I'm not sure if I'd be willing or able to continue taking online classes. There's a couple things that I need to take into consideration:

1) Scholarships. They pay for a majority of my schooling, and I actually haven't taken out any private loans because of them. (I do have government loans, and any extra I pay out of pocket)

2) Loans. If I take time off, I'm going to have to begin paying off my loans. I don't have much in savings and COVID-19 is going to make it hard to find a good job

3) Learning gap. I'm a music education major, and so I'm learning a ton of instruments, lots of other music things, along with a lot of education related things like how to run a classroom. If I take time off, I'm probably going to forget some of those things.

My school is in merced County that area was once purple and now red, part of the COVID tiers in California. If the county is in red for along enough time it means they can start to reopen. This with the news that now the majority, not all but many are also in red tiers. Only 10 out of 58 are still in purple tier. This means that if everyone from my school comes back to school it would pretty much be the same across each county.

My problem with this is one, it means that reopening will take longer than it possibly could, in a decently safe manner, of course never reopening is the most safe option, in my opinion probably not the best.

I am a part of multiple clubs, but there is almost nothing going on because of Covid. I often compare myself to others, and its really hurting my self esteem. I try to ignore what others are doing, but I often feel FOMO, and I believe that me staying in my room is comparatively worse than going outside and hanging out with friends.

And so the advisor said I can email my therapist since I recently started seeing a therapist since covid. My grandma with dementia also stays over for periods at a time and there’s 6 people at my house and I just can’t sit down and studying or do long assignments like I used to.

Hopefully the therapist is understanding when I ask him if I can get an email, and also the advisor said he can write me an additionally email supporting me.

This professor had two huge assignments due the first week and I totally got her due dates mixed up from being flustered with the new system. I started with two fat zeros and even getting As on the quizzes and midterm haven’t brought it up much.

As well, take advantage of counseling resources at your school. It is NOT weak to see a counselor to talk through the way you are feeling, and you should be able to do a virtual meeting. \nAs far as the application process goes, that is what the essay is for. They will understand that you took a mental health break due to the pandemic. I do disagree with another commenter that taking gap time is a waste. It isn’t a waste for some people. You can’t do well in school if you aren’t at your best physically and mentally.

as the title states: I fear that I'm in over my head, and I don't know what to do. I'm majoring in psychology, and where I live that means you'll have to conquer Statistics I, II and III + multiple other courses that are heavily reliant on stat. Now, uni has only started 5 weeks ago, and I already feel vastly overwhelmed by statistics, and especially since all of it is basically self-study due to covid19, I feel like I could stare & read my book for hours and still learn nothing, I'm not good abstract number-stuff like math and statistics so I'm very much not ejoying it, to say the least. 

I enjoy most of the other classes, and definitely think they're doable. I'm quite good at studying/memorisation, so the psychology, biology & other classes should be fine. But since I already can't keep up this early in the semester with stat, idk what to do. I also moved to a different city where I only have two friends, who are majoring in something else, so it's not like I can ask friends to help me cuz I don't have any yet (thanks again, covid :))

Anyways I'm stressing a lot about this and haven't been able to relax since stat started going downhill so if anyone has experienced something similar or w/e, all the advice is welcome..","['Hey there. I just want you to know that almost every major is “hard”. Everyone at least has a class they hate, a class they can’t understand or one they have difficulty keeping up with.

I was honestly extremely scared when I saw that I had it as a subject, and then psychophysiology, and now psychobiology (which I don’t even know why I’m taking in English… (I’m Spanish)) and a few more in the following years. Anyways, I actually studied technology in high school so I got to college with my close to none knowledge about biology. The teachers brushed off some topics since they were supposedly already studied in high school and were “basic” (definitely not for me) and I had to work extra hard. I don’t even know how many videos on YT I had to watch to actually understand things and how many emails I sent to my teachers filled with questions. It was a frustrating and I invested more time in that subject than most people (and later on even more time in psychophysiology) but I made it at the end. I also spent a gap year before getting into college so the habit of studying was long forgotten. \n\nI can’t really advise you much more besides asking your teacher everything you need (that’s what they’re there for), ask them if there’s any material that could help you and try to look for videos online (I had to watch quite a few for statistics as well).

If not this time maybe later, but don’t worry since you’ll eventually do it :D seriously, even if you fail, what’s the big deal, you’ll just have to try again, so have some confidence!  Also, if you’re doing good in the other subjects, just invest a tiny bit more of time on this one (but don’t overwork yourself ofc). And, if you truly feel like you can’t do it… maybe take the semester off and think things over? \n\nGood luck love! \nMan, sorry for typing so much without a proper advice...

What does that means when she never texts first? College love story,0,jaeqha,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jaeqha/what_does_that_means_when_she_never_texts_first/,4,"I’m a 18 Yo freshman student. By the way, I’m black. I moved to college on August 17 and that same day, I met a beautiful and wonderful white girl. Let’s call her Samantha, obviously not her real name. 
The day I arrived, I was sitting in my room and I saw multiple group meetings outside. As a professional photographer, I went outside with my camera and I asked an RA if I could take pictures of people in the meetings and he said yes. As I was taking pictures, there she was. She had a mask on her first but it’s like I could see her beauty through the mask. I immediately fell in love. I took a couple of pictures of her and I said to myself that I was going to talk to her when she’s done but I had to go in a meeting as well that same evening and by the time my meeting was over, so was already hers. 
I went in my room that night and I started editing the pictures. While I was editing hers, I felt like my heart was popping out of my stomach. I knew it was love because I had never felt like that before while editing a picture. I promise myself to find her.
I kept looking for her for days, 5 to be precise, but I couldn’t find her. My heart was hurting me too much so I tried to move on. 
In only 3 days, I talked to, and took the numbers, Instagram, and Snap of a total of 15 girls on campus. I started talking to all of them hoping that I’d fall in love and forget Samantha but it wasn’t working. 
*The day I met her again*
I went to one of the dining all do get food. While I was waiting on the line, I saw a girl that looked like her. In my heart, I knew It was her but I wasn’t sure because you know, she was wearing a mask because of COVID-19. So I looked at her and the pictures of her that I had taken to look for similar features. 
She had earrings but in the pictures, her hair covered her ears so I couldn’t figure things out. Then, I noticed that she was wearing a necklace then I looked at the pictures and saw the same necklace. Then, I knew it was her. 
I went to her, I showed her the pictures and she confirmed that it was her so I took her IG. 
I immediately stopped talking to the other girls, Haha!
We texted with each other for like 2 and a half days and on a Tuesday morning, I asked her if we could go out and take a walk. I didn’t mention it was a date but I think she kinda figured it out. 
At 8pm, we met outside and started talking. She took off her mask so I took mine off as well. 
We walked for like 40 minutes. We talked a lot, I made her talk a lot about herself because I wanted to get to know her and I think she liked that. I asked her questions and she did the same. 
She was so nice, beautiful, so talented. She made smile so much. Man, I’m telling you, anyone would have fallen in love. 
After the date, I walked her to her door. She said she had a great time and all of that. I was stressed out because I didn’t know if she was sincere about what she said and less than 10 minutes later, she texted me and told me that she had a great time and would love to go out with me again. 
We were on Campus for 2 more weeks until they asked us to go home because some kids got COVID-19 and they wanted to limit the spread. 
When we got the news, she texted me and that was the only time she texted me first. I’ve been talking to her for almost 2 months, and I’m always the first one to text first and to be honest, I’m getting tired of this.
Since I started talking to her, I texted her almost every day and since I was always the first one to do so, I kinda got fired of this. 
3 weeks ago, I said I wasn’t going to text her again and see what she’d do. I didn’t text her for 3 days and she never texted me either.
Last week was a really busy week. I had midterm exams and all of that so I didn’t text her for more than 10 days and she never texted me either.
I texted her 2 days ago since I had some free time and we haven’t texted each other since. So, I’m guessing I’ll have to text her again and to be honest, I get the sense that she’s just not interested. 
I think I’mma stop texting her from now on and I won’t do so until she texts me first. I wrote all this because I wanted to know what Y’all think I should do. Thank you!","['She’s not interested, or she would’ve text you back. Leave her be and move on. Good luck bud', 'Love is a delusion. Humans are disgusting.

Housing Advice?,1,ja6qam,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ja6qam/housing_advice/,1," Hi! I am currently a sophomore and am not on campus because all of my classes are online due to COVID. But for this year, my roommate and I were supposed to live with this two other girls on campus (we've never met them but have met them through our class' facebook group). My roommate ended up switching schools anyway, so now I do not have anyone to live with (that I am super close to) for the rest of my time in college. Anyways...

The same two girls that we were supposed to live with this year, messaged me the other day and asked if I would want to rent a house with them off campus next year, along with another girl (most juniors and seniors rent houses/apartments at my school, so it is a normal thing to ask). But on the other hand, my other friends (a guy, and about three other girls) asked if I would want to live in an off-campus apartment with them next year. I have to let them know by the end of this week since they are leasing it soon.

So here's the dilemma: I do not know if I should rent a house with the girls, or live in an apartment with people I am already friends with (I am only really close with the guy; we are not dating because he is not straight, but he is my best friend on campus). The thing is, the house is right across the street from campus so I can just walk right to class and the rent is fairly cheap, while the apartment buildings (one of which my friends want to live in) are far away, so that means I would have to walk like 20 minutes in a bad neighborhood, or buy myself a car to drive to class everyday and then pay for a parking ticket. The girls who are renting the house already have the house picked out, while my friends do have any plans set in stone... and I also am not sure how or if five people are going to fit into an apartment. And as for the girls who have asked me if I wanted to rent a house with them, I am nervous that they will not like me or that I won't like them/find them to be rude; I get along with everyone I meet, but people have seemed to dislike me in the past and I am nervous that it will happen again. And the fact that I have never met them makes me even more nervous. I do want to find a close group of girl friends though and feel as though this is my chance. I also do not want to hurt my friends' feelings though -- the group of people renting the apartment, because I am really close with the one, and feel as though he'll be really upset if I choose not to live with them.

What would you do? Or what do you think I should do? I just need some advice/guidance lol. I am so lost. Thank you!","['Honestly, I would make every effort not to live with college aged females that I don’t know. However, if you have your own room and had the ability to keep to yourself if they were too terrible, I would consider risking it. 20 minutes walking is too long, isn’t safe, and wouldn’t work given certain weather possibilities.

I quit tennis after 9th grade and scale modeling after 8th because I needed more time to study.

Its much easier to be alone when you have something you enjoy doing alone. And not to sound like a boomer (Im only 20) but try and back off from social media if you use it. Itll definitely be tempting to try and stay up to date with whats going on with your friends because you arent seeing them in person anymore, but it honestly only makes you more sad.

Try a new food place once a week, go study in a new area or outside when the weather is nice, etc. Dont stay in your room.

I have been feeling really lonely all year, feel like I have been seriously missing out on great opportunities and making friends.

"Would it look ""bad"" on my resume if I transfer schools again?",5,j8xkde,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j8xkde/would_it_look_bad_on_my_resume_if_i_transfer/,7,"Hello everyone,

I am in a bit of a dilemma and need advice. So I am a sophomore in college. I began my college journey in 2018 but I started out having to take low-level/remedial courses in the beginning since I scored low on the placement tests. The first school I went to was a STEM school because I ""thought"" I wanted to be a software engineer. It was an online school. I completed about 30 credits there until I realized tech wasn't my forte, so I transferred to a different school. 

The school I transferred to was out of state (Florida) because my boyfriend lives there and I wanted to be closer to him in person. My first semester there was fabulous! I loved the campus and the community. However, good ole' COVID came along and my campus experience was cut short mid-semester. My major at this school is Health Sciences but I planned on applying to their BSN program. I was in the process of completing the prerequisites. 

Fast forward to now, I found out that I will not be able to apply to the Nursing program this year because I do not have all the prereqs completed. They only admit once a year to the BSN program and I would have to wait until the Fall of next year to reapply. Even then, I wouldn't be able to start my clinical courses until 2022. That would dramatically push back my graduation year. My goal is to become a nurse and then an NP. I basically told everyone I know that I am a future NP. Like, everyone. 

My family is rooting for me and so is my boyfriend. I really do not want to be delayed in my career path so I applied to a local nursing school in my home state and just found out that I was accepted! They actually don't require any prereqs as the courses are built into the curriculum. All that's required is an entrance test and I scored exceptionally well on that. I really want to accept this offer and start in the Spring but I am not sure what I should do. I feel bad about transferring schools twice. I am worried that this mess of transcripts will look bad on my resume.

I am just looking for some advice on how I should approach. Is there such thing as too many transfers on your record? Thank you for your help!

I feel really bad that I've transferred so many times but I also feel like this is such a good opportunity that I can't pass up.

So,  I have a 2 hr exam for an online science course soon from a UC and the  policy is that webcam must be on while on zoom. So far, I havn't really  had too much internet problems ( I get occasional disconnects during the  lecture where zoom freezes saying my connection is unstable but I can  still hear the lecture) when other students have their webcam on during  lecture (it is not mandatory, just optional) but out of 65-70 students,  less than 15 people usually had their camera on consistently during the  lecture (I have no idea what will happen when all 65-70 students have  their camera on).

I have a 2013  macbook (this is my only computer, I cannot afford a new one hence why  its old) , it runs ok but when I have the camera on for skype/ zoom/  anything demanding a camera, my internet just decides to  disconnect/reconnect me constantly (does this every few sec to mins),  drop video frames (I go from a little fuzzy to ""what is that blurry  figure""), or if i'm really unlucky, disconnect completely for more than a  couple min and I have to just completely turn off my camera.

I'm  worried that b/c of my not so up to date computer and/ not so great  internet, I'm going to risk disconnecting during the exam and be seen as  cheating. I've emailed my professor about it and he is willing to  compromise but is asking what do I think is fair to do. Honestly, I  don't know what to do. With the COVID situation, I'm not comfortable  going anywhere with a public wifi b/c its distracting for me. Moreover, a  2hr exam on PUBLIC wifi just has even more problems. I'm not sure if  anyone else in the class has my problem but assuming no one else has  problems, it obviously wouldn't be fair that everyone has to have their  camera on while I don't because of my technical problems.

What  is a good/fair compromise for this? I've had other classes that since  the possibility of ""cheating"" or technical problems especially due to  the situation is difficult to avoid, they've just made all exams open  note/book, and its the student's responsibility to know the material in  the end especially if they want to pursue more advanced courses, the  class' topic is associated with an outside exam (i.e. MCAT), and etc.","['For now, consider getting an ethernet adapter since a wired connection will definitely be a lot more stable. \n\nBut I think the wifi issue might be a software-related issue and reinstalling macOS might fix it (create a backup before if you do this).', ""Zoom lets me log in on 2 devices with the same account.

Maybe making sure you're using the cell network if it's your wifi that has issues, or not if it's your laptop that can't keep up.\n\nAlso maybe mention what you're doing to the instructor first so they're not too confused when you're logged in twice.""]",10/10/20 17:37

I recently started my first year of college and I don't know if I like it yet. I think my classes are interesting and I'm waiting for them to pick up. But it's been almost a month and I don't love what I'm doing.  I am having a lot of battles in my mind about my expectations vs reality of being at college and its exhausting.

I think COVID has taken a huge toll on me. I am having a very hard time staying attentive in my online classes, I came to college for hands-on learning cause that's best for me. I think once COVID is over I'll like my classes more but I'm worried that even after COVID I won't enjoy my program. I can't tell if the problem is COVID, the program or both. 

COVID has also been super detrimental to my mental health, I moved to residence this year even with COVID because I wanted the experience and so did my parents. Everyone told me how amazing residence was gonna be and how much fun it is and how they're so happy they did it. But getting here, having to distance and feeling the need to isolate yourself is hard. I am a super extroverted person, and while there are residence events, I've made good friends, and I really like having my own environment I function super well. But being alone is draining. I want to feel like I don't have to be alone, but even going to people's rooms makes me nervous cause I have so much COVID-related anxiety. 

Many other factors in my life are contributing to me feeling shitty lately. But I can't figure out if I'm happy. I think I'm currently at a low point mentally and it's making me overthink everything. It feels like waiting till COVID is over might help so much, but what if it doesn't end? And I wasted thousands on a wish that a pandemic would go away?

It\'s the worst of what college has to offer, to be honest. \n\n> But I can\'t figure out if I\'m happy.\n\nYou don\'t need to figure it out now. One month in is nothing. \n\n> It feels like waiting till COVID is over might help so much, but what if it doesn\'t end?\n\nIt will end. Even in a worst case scenario with no vaccine, it will end. My understanding of viruses is that like everything else, their trajectory is at the whim of the nature of evolution. Only the strains that reproduce survive, and those that don\'t reproduce die off. You know what makes it very hard for a virus to reproduce? Killing a person. The virus can\'t spread from a dead person. \n\nThis is a long winded way of saying that nature tends to make viruses weaker over time, and covid is no exception. Even without a vaccine, covid will most likely eventually become so weak that we can handle having it around. And that\'s the *worst* case scenario where we *don\'t* have a vaccine. There was no vaccine for the Spanish Flu. Shit sucked for a while back then. Eventually it got weak and people went back to normal. The Spanish flu believe it or not is still around.

Any advice on safe places to study on campus? Or ways to meet up with friends you haven’t seen/talked to in a while? I’ve been thinking of being more active in clubs I know they’re active in, so I might try that.

One of my roommates has been going to the library and cafes, and she’s been fine and still tests negative.

At that time, we were basically family. Although we haven't talked in a few years, it's hit me very hard. I'm a 4.0 student (though I work hard to get it). I found out the news in the middle of a chemistry exam, which the instructor let me retake another day. I took it the next day because I had felt bad for having to stop partway through (my fault), and received a 67% on the test (expected). I take around 15 quarter credits per term, and I've been fine thus far. But, I don't know how to keep my academics up.

I just don't know what to do here. Luckily, I'm able to keep up in my two other classes. My chemistry class (the one I got the 67% in), however, is fully online (no teacher), which I struggle with anyways.

What should I do? Should I continue taking chemistry? (I have about 20 points leeway that I can miss under an A grade). Should I withdraw, if so now or when I know I can't get an A?

And what should I do?,3,j6u2mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j6u2mr/i_feel_lost_in_college_and_i_want_to_drop_out/,3,"Hey everyone, I hope you’re all having a great day. I’m considering dropping out of school. For some backstory, I have never been passionate about school and ever since high school I’ve been a C average student. I think being an educated member of society is very important, but I don’t think that going through traditional american schooling equates to being “educated” necessarily. With that said I’ll get into my situation. Last year I was a freshman at a university in New Haven, Conn. I live in New Jersey so going out of state and having the “college experience” was what I wanted more than any other aspect of college. Not long into the year I started to have this gut feeling which told me I didn’t belong there. I was a psych major but I dropped my intro to psych class after the second meeting and switched my major to business management. Soon enough I wasn’t waking up to go to any of my classes, it got so bad that I would tell myself if I just went to half the classes on my schedule per week, that was a success. I spent most of my time alone in my dorm room by myself (as my roommate was always in class) doing nothing but drowning in youtube, scrolling through twitter, and smoking weed/vaping my e-cigs continuously throughout the day. I also began drinking whenever I wanted and would sometimes show up to my larger lectures completely wasted. I ended up getting kicked out of my freshman seminar writing class due to absences and I got myself put on academic probation. As a result of my grades, I also lost the financial aid given to me from the school which for me, meant I’d no longer be able to attend after the second semester. I came back to school for the second semester seeking redemption and did far better academically and actually went from academic probation to making dean’s list, but I still did not feel like I was doing what I’m meant to be doing. But I must say it felt damn good to prove to myself I’m capable of doing well if I wanted to. Then, COVID struck and in mid-march I was sent home. I finished out the year on Zoom. Now I’m in my first semester of sophomore year, but this time I’m at a local community college fully online listening to lectures while half-asleep in my childhood bedroom. Most of my friends are away so it’s been pretty lonely and the freedom I had last year is all but gone. I’m one step away from getting my real estate license and recently I’ve been teaching myself computer programming. I read books for hours per day and I’ve deleted my Instagram and Twitter accounts, I’ve also gotten a better grip on my nicotine habit and have my weed usage under control. I hit the gym 4-5 days a week and have improved my diet greatly. But here’s the thing, I haven’t logged into my Zoom classes since the first week of the semester. I notice that when I’m not concerned with school, I take more responsibility for my “real” life and I fill my time doing more productive things which I actually enjoy and feel fulfilled doing. I come from a lower middle class family and neither of my parents have college degrees so they are expecting me to be the first in the family to finish college. They’re scared that if I drop out that I will face the same career-related struggles that they have. However, during my time away at my former university I’ve heard and seen so many unfulfilled and unmotivated students say that they wish they could drop out, or they are “only getting my degree to make my parents happy”. I can fully relate to that, except with my financial background, I do not have the luxury to place myself deep(er) into student-loan debt just to appease my parents. I feel like life and time are both so precious that you’d be foolish to spend it working hard for something that you truly do not even want. I dream of being a successful entrepreneur even if it means working on my craft tirelessly and having a limited social life. I feel like chasing your dream and doing what you were put on earth to do, is more rewarding than going out to a bar/club on weekends. I also am deathly afraid of wasting my life in a cubicle or office working for a boss I hate and a company I have no interest in with no way out. Can anyone else relate to this? PLEASE share your story if so. Also, should I drop out? I know that if I pursued my real estate interest that I have a willing mentor lined up (who does very well for himself and is very financially secure) and I also can see myself pursuing computer programming and maybe making apps or something one day. I also currently have a part time and I’m earning a decent wage and I’m building up my savings account to something from nothing so at minimum, I have a means of survival if all else fails. I’m sorry this was such a long post, I wasn’t expecting it to be.

Shortened/Voided Fall Breaks,1,j6jvlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j6jvlf/shortenedvoided_fall_breaks/,3,"So I'm writing this at the end of my so-called 'fall break', and I'm just curious to see who else feels the same. My college has cut fall break to two days (it was Monday, and today), which would have been fine since the weekend exists, right?

Well. Something about covid has made professors feel really great about dropping due dates regularly on Saturdays and Sundays, so - those two days didn't really feel like much of a break. Which brings it down to two days. However, with a bio lab practical on Friday that I need to study for, and a psych exam the following Monday, not to mention 30-40 hours of /work/ in general outside of school - I'm exhausted. And I know that about this point in the semester is really where I usually feel tired, but it's also when we usually get at least an uninterrupted 3 or 4-day break. I mean for christ's sake, we even had homework on labor day. 

Don't get me wrong, I know I definitely don't have the worst time in all this. In fact, a quick google search showed that a lot of colleges are cutting out breaks entirely. I feel like this is just going to end up hurting us students in the end. I am so god damn overwhelmed it's not even funny. The lack of an actual break is grating on my mental health. Hell, I missed an assignment just because my brain feels so cluttered and busy that I somehow overlooked it. I bet you, even professors need the breaks too, the constant stream of grading work has to hurt...

Feeling hopeless.,6,j3zxvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j3zxvm/considering_dropping_out_feeling_hopeless/,2,"I did great my first year way back in 2016 when I lived at home, and only worked 10 hours a week.  Striaght As with 1 B.  The following year my mom remarried, moved out of state, and suddenly I had to work 30+ hours a week and manage my own household, roommates, etc.  I was homeless for a long stretch as well.

Right now I am struggling to take classes part time online while I work full time.  I wasn't even supposed to be full time, they just need me so often because of covid that I hit 40 hours every week.  I have to pay rent, I can't just leave, and I can't say no.  I'm three weeks behind on my classes and we're only a month into the course.  I have today and tomorrow off so I am going to be catching up and working at it, but right now I'm just plunking away at a degree that might not even fucking do anything for me and that I am no longer interested in due to burnout.

I tried taking a year off, and my first semester back I failed all my classes.  The next semester I took two classes and still failed one.  Then, I passed both my classes the semester after that.  I'm on semester 4 now and feel like I've made virtually no progress.  I have been in school for 4 years and still have not managed to earn a fucking 2 year degree.  It makes me beyond depressed.

This is so fucking hard for no real reason and I hate it.  I hate it *so much*.  I hate my shitty retail job and I want to do something in my arena of interest but it seems impossible at this point because this country is intent on grinding people without an inheritance into dust.  

I wish I could just check out of my life and put a little bookmark in and go to school full time.  Just live on campus like other people, and go full time, but I can't for a whole host of reasons (namely-- I can't even begin to afford the kind of debt that would incur.  I have no college fund and my EFC is laughably astronomical for someone who has been an independent on my taxes this entire goddamn time).","[""I am very sorry to hear of the difficult circumstances you are facing.  Life can really pile on sometimes.\n\nI'm going to give you my honest, best advice: I think you should leave school until your personal circumstances are more stable.  That might take one year, or it might take 10 years.  But, based on what you have written, it seems to me that the cold, hard reality is that your personal circumstances simply are not suitable at the present time for attending college while you work.  You have to work to pay rent and keep food on the table, that's absolutely clear.  You stated that your academic performance has suffered terribly because of the other requirements on your time.  So, honestly, why pay money to go to school when, at present, you are not in a position to be able to do well?  I see no point in using some of your limited and hard-earned money to pay for classes that you cannot devote a sufficient amount of time to in order to do well.  You might eventually graduate, but a transcript full of C's and D's isn't going to be very impressive to a potential employer when there are probably 50 other applicants.\n\nIt's hard, and I know that leaving school will feel like a defeat, but I can assure you it isn't.  Making an adult decision to do what you need to do to get your personal situation under control is a mark of responsibility, not of failure.  Do whatever you need to do to get your finances and personal circumstances under control, and then go back to school.  I promise that a college degree will still be there waiting for you.\n\nGood luck."", ""What degree are you working on? If you degree will lead directly to a job, I would stick with it no matter how hard it is. If it won't, I'd consider doing something else, like getting a degree that will give you a job, getting an apprenticeship, going to trade school, starting a business, or joining the military. I really have no idea what you're good at or like doing. I know what you don't like, which is hardships, but hardships are just life.""]",10/2/20 22:21

Idk what to do. The closest grocery store is miles away and i dont have a car. All of the other food places i can access are fast food. Is anyone else dealing with a similar problem? If so how do you find healthy food to eat?

I just substitute the following meal with one of those shakes. \n\n\n- If you want to cook I would recommend meal prepping. Grilled chicken, Raman/instant rice and frozen broccoli is the way to go in my opinion. It's cheap (I think under 2$ a meal)  and doesn't get much healthier. All your need is a few tupperware containers, a pan, olive oil/seasoning.

So I spent 3 semesters at this college and quite literally failed every single course. 0.0 gpa. 0.0 overall gpa. Turns out thats a recipe for getting you kicked out of a school. I took a semester and summer off barely worked and then went back to school at a community college and kicked reasonable ass(A's and B's and a C...). I've been at the community college for a year now starting my third semester right now.

&#x200B;

So i started taking my first computer science courses a year ago. I passed my first two flawlessly...well almost...but more on that in a bit. The first two I took were just intro to java courses because the college I go to splits them in two. The comp sci. classes were really easy and I passed both with an A. During my first two semesters of comp sci. I also took a lot of math. My second semester I took 3 math courses all of which I passed with A's and B's. This current semester I am taking Algorithms and Data Structures, I am not struggling with the information in the course. I read, study and code what I am told to. The problem that I am running into that I did not encounter during my two previous semesters is hard due dates. Previous semesters all due dates were soft due dates aka ""suggestions."" This current semester whether because of covid and lots of classes being online or not, I have hard due dates in all my classes math and computer science. I am not good with due dates. I know that I should be but I am just not good with them. I'm basically already screwed in all my classes since we're a month in and I haven't done anything outside of taking notes because I ALWAYS miss the due date. At the start of this I said I completed my previous Java classes flawlessly and that's because there were no hard due dates except for exams! I would take lots of notes and then turn in assignments and programs in my own time. I did completely fine on Exams because I had this extra time to complete things. Now I don't and I can't fix it.","[""Ok.

Something I realized is that I tend to focus so much on my studying that I don't want to focus on other non-academic things. Here's the context or story:

I was fortunate enough to secure an internship for the upcoming summer. One of the required steps was to do a drug screening/test before a specific date (let's say December 7th. Also I got this email like one week in advance), which is smack in the middle (a little before actually) of my finals season. 

I missed this drug screening.

And I have to go through a more tedious process of reapplying/rescheduling the drug test. 

And on another somewhat related note, I noticed went to the gym a lot less during finals week and sort of had this like ""why waste an hour or two a day at the gym when you can use that hour or two studying?"" mentality?

An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We're Opening This Fall,4913,hxd9z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hxd9z8/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/,182,"Dear faculty,

Oh, and staff. Sorry, we keep forgetting you exist. So sorry. You're like the middle child of higher education. You've been so quiet since you realized that unlike faculty we'll actually fire you for speaking up.

Many of you have expressed concern with our plans to move ahead with in-person classes this fall. I personally find the plan to be relatively simple.

All we need to do to safely and successfully reopen is require everyone to wear a mask at all times, test all students, faculty and staff for COVID-19 before fall semester starts, require all students to self-isolate for 14 days before they arrive, split most of our classes into two groups that will never meet together in-person, remove half the furniture from all of our classrooms and public spaces, dedicate entire ~~dorms~~ residence halls to housing sick students, train faculty to live stream their classes to remote students while juggling the virtual and in-person management of questions and feedback, assume students will maintain physical distance and wear masks when they're off campus, assume students won't go to any parties, prep faculty to move to remote instruction immediately if they get sick or have to self-quarantine, require faculty to designate a ""colleague on call"" to serve as their academic next of kin who'll teach their class for no additional pay if they get sick or die, rearrange foot traffic patterns in all of our buildings and stairwells, dramatically increase cleaning responsibilities for our overstretched environmental services team, completely change how we distribute food in dining halls, set the HVAC to blow as hard as possible in every building to keep air flow moving, hope our toxic work culture doesn't lead to people coming in sick despite us not updating our sick or leave policies to accommodate for a generational pandemic, and cross our fingers that we get to the point in the semester where we don't have to give refunds for housing or dining plans when we move to all online instruction anyway.

I don't see what's so complicated.

But since you all keep *insisting* on asking why we're taking such a ""risk"" in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic in a country with a negligent federal response and a bunch of morons who think this is all a hoax and that mask wearing is how Bill ""5G"" Gates will steal their rights or whatever, I'm writing to clarify the university's motivations for fall.

**Money.**

Oh my god *we're so boned* if we don't get more money.

Do you not realize how much of our funding is based on dramatically overpriced housing and food? Do you not know what an auxiliary service is? *Have you not noticed a bottle of Diet Coke is $4.50 in the cafeteria?* Do you not come to the budget meetings we schedule once a year at 6:30pm the Friday before a holiday weekend?

Our endowment is like your savings account: Woefully inadequate and incapable of saving you. If we lose that sweet, sweet housing and food money we are going to have to fire at least a third of you to keep our own jobs safe, but at least we'll have a good reason to ditch those of you with tenure we don't like because you criticized us once three years ago. I'm coming for you, *Christina*.

So buck up, cupcake. Be resilient. Double your workload so you can help us maintain the façade that opening for in-person instruction is somehow going to be safe until we hit the tuition and housing due date.

We *need you* to do all this extra work so we can get that sweet, sweet student money and stay afloat. *You* are how we are going to get through this. ~~We're going to squeeze you dry and then ask for more (NOTE: Let's remove this line before we hit send).~~ By the way, here's a website about self-care that has three broken links to in-person yoga classes from last year.

This *will* involve you spending the summer designing your course twice for both in-person and online instruction. Extra funding? Hahahahahaha Nah, but here's a webcam and the login page for Zoom. Make it work.

To answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K12 school districts are going to be starting the school year online. As such, I've directed HR to do absolutely nothing to accommodate those of you who have been audacious enough to procreate. Figure it out. We can always replace you with a grad student or post doc who's desperate enough to barely scrape by. Your call.

What? No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.

Yes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.

No, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.

Yes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff. Unrelated note: Did I mention we're changing the name of that building that's been named after a white supremacist the past 83 years? I, for one, am grateful to be a part of solving racism forever.

Where was I again? Oh yes, money.

We need money to under pay you, the staff, and the adjuncts who teach 83% of our courses. So take this mask we paid too much to put our logo on and get to work. At least until the tuition refund deadline passes.

Love,

Your University President

Getting a diagnosis for inattentive ADHD at 24 changed my life as a student,16,j1ktcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j1ktcw/getting_a_diagnosis_for_inattentive_adhd_at_24/,2,"It took me 6 years (7 including taking off 2019 for surgeries) to get my associates degree. I thought anxiety and depression were mostly to blame, my primary symptoms being brain fog, feeling slow, test/math anxiety, severe procrastination, poor memory, and an inability to focus. I would get distracted by my own thoughts as often as outside distractions, music was always playing in my head making it hard to separate my thoughts, and sitting down to focus on a lecture or homework caused physical discomfort in my body. I was never hyperactive.

I decided to get help when I found it impossible to apply to university after taking 2019 off even though I desperately wanted to learn. I hated my retail job and knew that I would feel good about myself if I was in school, but couldn’t bring myself to apply. I would cry myself to sleep wondering why I still hadn’t just done what I needed and wanted to do. So I started therapy for anxiety. I had seen a silly reddit thread about people who never finish games/projects/etc that turned out to have ADHD and decided to ask about it. Within a month I had a diagnosis. 

I cannot overstate how life changing it was to receive a diagnosis as an adult. I was able to make all the phone calls, emails, and papers I needed to apply for university and was accepted! I learned I wasn’t lazy, but that I had a problem with executive function because of my brain chemistry. I wasn’t slow or stupid, my brain actually couldn’t focus on demand due to a lack of certain neurotransmitters. A lot of my anxiety (test and social) was related to my distractibility, turns out losing track in the middle of a thought/conversation or dealing with intrusive thoughts was directly causing most of my anxiety. My inability to remember important things like phone calls, returning texts, appointments, and bills was a result of brain chemistry, not a lack of willpower.

It took a bit to find the right medicine for me, but the difference is night and day. Methylphenidate quiets my mind, suddenly the 2-3 choruses constantly playing in my head stops. When I think “I need to do the laundry” I get up and do it. When it’s time to study I sit down for 2-3 hours at a time, and after a short break I’m no longer derailed for the rest of the day but can actually go back to studying. Outside of school, I’ve seen improvements in my ability to stay on top of chores, bills, self care, and keeping up with friends. Even on my relaxing days, I actually take the time to do hobbies I enjoy instead of just browsing reddit and watching Netflix all day. I passed an online course for the first time, not just passed but got the highest grade I’ve ever received in any class (sorry to sound braggy but it’s still so amazing to me).

Every single person I talk to about ADHD symptoms says they deal with those things too, so maybe they have ADHD too. Much like depression, ADHD is a scale and has to do with severity. Everyone gets sad sometimes, but only some people are depressed. Everyone feels lazy, procrastinates, and hates focusing on hard projects sometimes, but you only have ADHD if it really impacts your life and always has. A big part of diagnosing ADHD is evaluating how it affected you as a child and getting feedback from your parents.

I discovered my ADHD thanks to reddit, so I thought I’d make a post and hopefully help someone else on this path! Take a look at some online ADHD checklists and if you really feel that your symptoms impact your life, go speak to a doctor. Even if it isn’t ADHD you may find some useful techniques to help with your symptoms, or get another useful diagnosis. 

**TL;DR** Took 6 years to get my AS, couldn’t bring myself to do things I really wanted like applying to university. Dealt with brain fog, severe procrastination, anxiety, etc, almost all turned out to be result of ADHD. Since getting my diagnosis/medicine I’ve applied and been accepted to university, my self confidence is through the roof, my social anxiety is a thing of the past, and I know what it’s like to think and do things like a “normal”, neurotypical person.","['I’m glad you made this post. I’ve never been diagnosed with ADHD but I might look into seeing if I have it because I am severely disorganized (always have been), a severe procrastinator, always distracted by my thoughts, and can’t stay on top of anything consistently. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve taken an aptitude test and education is the right path for me but I’m consistently screwing it up to the point where I don’t know if I should consider dropping out or not. My school doesn’t treat ADHD though so that’s why I haven’t tried getting tested. The doctors believe it’s just depression and anxiety but I’ve been this way all my life.']",9/29/20 1:00
Exhausted and anxious with learning in general...what can I do to improve?,4,iy5k8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iy5k8x/exhausted_and_anxious_with_learning_in/,0,"TLDR: I get overwhelmed at times and also get frustrated when I can’t grasp concepts fast enough, then I end up questioning my life. I also get anxious when checking grades because I worry about how it will affect my future endeavors and also how big of a disappointment I am to my family. Looking for tips to improve. 

Hi, first, I hope everyone is staying safe. I am currently taking classes online, and chem is taking up a big chunk of my time for this semster. I enjoy chem, but at times I get really frustrated because I just can’t get the material/concepts in my head. Things are also super fast paced, so if I can’t grasp a concept in time, I get really overwhelmed. But the thing is, it’s not THAT hard. And, when I finally master a concept, other people seemed to have known it way before. Then I wonder what in the world I’m doing wrong. This discourages me because it makes me feel incompetent, and I keep thinking twice about continuing the pre-med path (then going to a prestigious med school). And if I did happen to part from the med world, I can’t imagine what else I can do. This also stresses me out because I want to pursue a medical career and I don’t want to disappoint my parents (they say it’s fine if I mess up, but they look really upset when they say that).
Another thing was about checking grades. I get really bad anxiety when checking my grades because I cannot afford to get another grade below an A (I messed up big time first year, grade-wise and mentally). I guess when I see that I did crap on an assessment, I often wonder if I can even manage anything in life (this sounds dramatic, I know), and then I start getting worried about how I can support myself with my incompetence. Then I feel unmotivated to even do anything. 
Sorry if I sound really narrow minded here. I come from a rather strict family with high expectations, and when I mess up, I feel really discouraged. I also have too many worries sometimes, so this might contribute to my overthinking. 
I would appreciate if anyone could share some tips, like how to study better, or how to think in a more positive manner, self-care tips (affordable ones though😅), etc. I try to do these things, but they often  take too much of my time and/or don’t take away my worries, even temporarily, so I am looking for more ideas. Thank you in advance, and once again, please stay safe!",[],9/23/20 11:21
"If time, money, and salary were not a concern, what path in college would you choose?",18,hiw2uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hiw2uq/if_time_money_and_salary_were_not_a_concern_what/,56,"TLDR: See the title.

Thanks in advance to those who read.

You have no obligations or worries for your future monetarily. Would you go for a degree that interests you, but doesn’t seem “worth it” currently? If all needs were met, would you even further your education at a university and still work? Would you just read and watch lectures from Ivy League schools to learn? Would you go to grad school? 

I ask because I’m semi-retired at 34 with no formal college education, but I am able to go now. Prior to my retirement I was working as a data and systems analyst. My employer offered to pay for my EMBA as they wanted me in a higher position, but my child was diagnosed with leukemia a week later. Lemons all over life, but she’s a healthy kid now, and I made enough lemonade through contracting work to pay off cancer debt/retire. 

Now, I’m privileged with the opportunity to go wild. I love learning, but my blue collar family said “college wasn’t for us”. I’m chasing dreams of anthropology, philosophy, psychology, physics— I’ve not had the choice to do something I love before. I start next week. My kids are excited that mom is going to college haha.

So Reddit, I want to read what you would do if you had nothing encumbering. 

Side Note: I want to say to those with no support system and no money struggling to make something from nothing— don’t stop. You may choose your most profiting skills over your interests, but you can make yourself invaluable. Expand your opportunities when you can, budget, and always practice self care. Even if you lose it all, start over without hesitation. I never thought I’d work for myself and my kids so hard that I’d end up in college to actually follow dreams. I was told to give up and accept the end of my career, but I decided to reapply my skills as an entrepreneur.

"Some helpful tips for succeeding in school (basically, all the things I wish I had done differently)",78,ecokcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ecokcn/some_helpful_tips_for_succeeding_in_school/,2,"Hi all, title of post self-explanatory. These are all the things I wish I would have done differently if I could go back and redo my undergrad. Hopefully this will help someone out:

Tip #1 Take advantage of syllabus days. Just because you might not have any assignments due or take any notes on the first day doesn't mean you shouldn't try to get ahead. Read over each syllabus so you get an idea of exactly what is expected for each class. Start working on assignments the day you get each syllabus. Why should you wait to start working on assignments when you have them and their due dates already in front of you? Taking advantage of this can put you up to a week ahead on assignments, which will come in handy later in the semester when you're super busy and need a break from time to time.

Tip #2   Piggybacking off of tip #1, establish a study schedule based on your class schedule. If you're taking 5 classes and have three of them on M/W/F while the other two are on T/TH, do the homework for MWF classes on T/TH when you have more time and vice versa. Work on assignments for your hardest class every single day even if it's only for an hour at a time. Doing assignments between classes is also ideal, as it can be easier to remember the material and ""connect"" what you learned from one session to the next.

Tip# 3  Once you've figured out ""when"" to study, find ""where"" to study. If you do best in the quiet zone of the library, do your studying there. If at Starbucks, then go there. For me, the best spot when the weather was nice was on top of the building most of my classes were in (there was a pavilion specially built for sightseeing that you could look out and see the skyline of the city I live in, and it was lovely to hang out on during the summer/early fall).

Tip #4  Take one day a week to relax. Don't do any homework. If you have a job, see if it's possible to arrange your schedule so that you have that day off every week. Sleep in as late as you want to. Do things you like to do so you don't burn out.

Tip #5  Stay organized. File papers where they're supposed to go as soon as they're in your hand. Take some time each week to clean out folders/binders, update your planner, etc. Put things in the same spot every single time so you know where to find them and can grab them when you're in a hurry.

Tip #6   Don't let schoolwork get in the way of self-care. Eat healthy foods that will give you energy, drink plenty of water, take vitamins, keep good hygiene. Try to get to bed at the same time every night and give yourself enough time to sleep so that you feel refreshed. 

That's all I have so far. These were things that I didn't figure out until a lot later and my hope is that someone else will be wiser and not make some of the same mistakes I made.","['I love this;)', 'Thanks for laying out all the tips.

Advice Requested: How to Return to College after Flunking out,18,ecpqju,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ecpqju/advice_requested_how_to_return_to_college_after/,5,"Thought about using a throwaway for this but screw it. I’ve tried to try to keep this concise but I am a verbose writer. Still, if any clarification is needed, I’ll answer and edit the post if needed. 

**TLDR:** Depression, general life, and my inability to cope with it all wrecked my college career. I was suspended after my 8th semester (out of 10, since I was doing a double major). It’s been a year and a half now, and I’m about to attend community college to try getting my feet wet again and help my GPA. I don’t want to stay at a community college long, but I don’t know how much it’ll help my GPA. Is it at all possible to transfer to a university a GPA below 2.0, or would I need to wait? What about doing an associates? Any advice on how to hold myself upright this time around?

**Background:** I’ve had depression since I was about 11. My mental health worsened in high school and I got on medication when I was 16. About a year and a half later, I graduated from high school. I wasn’t top of my class, but I did do well (despite rough patches and honestly sometimes not even trying that hard), and I like to think I had good prospects. I had vague plans to go as far as grad school. I started at SUNY Binghamton in fall 2014. My first semester was alright for about a month...and then I ran out of medication. I wound up being off of it for a month and that wrecked me. Even after I obtained it again, I wasn’t able to catch up, and I had to medically withdraw for the semester. 

Spring semester was still rough and I only passed half of my classes, so I had to go into fall on probation. That summer, my parents split up and that was a mess to grapple with. The 2015-2016 school year had difficult spots, but I was able to make myself catch up on my work when needed, and I passed ALL of my classes--even made the dean’s list that fall while on probation! Sweet victories. 

At this point, my GPA was 2.67 going into fall 2016. And then, I don’t know what happened. Maybe it’s because I was suddenly taking 3 upper level courses at once and having to deal with family shit (being an intermediary for my parents who needed to communicate but only wanted trickles of information to flow through me) and trying to figure out my own mental health and grappling with other personal issues. I fell behind on work and took Incompletes in my courses so that I could catch up over winter break. Then I pushed them into spring...while already taking a maxed out semester course load. I made stupid choices thinking I could do it all. Then the Incompletes got pushed further and further forward while my life continued to crumble around me. My mental state looked brighter later in the semester, but it wasn’t enough. Surprise surprise, I wasn’t able to catch up on all that work, and all the Incompletes I had accumulated turned into F’s. And there went my GPA. Down to 1.52. Thus came suspension after spring 2018. 

I decided to move to Texas to live with my dad and step-family so I could try getting on my feet with the support of my dad and his resources. He pushed me to get a job so I’d have something to do with my time, so I’ve been working at a grocery store since early this year. I have had vague, on and off plans about how to move forward--getting my drivers license and a car, planning for school, staying on top of self care, returning to therapy.

Thing is...I’ve been stagnating. Self care is hard as fuck, and I have zero discipline to stick to anything that actually helps me, instead losing focus and just ignoring everything around me. My head often feels foggy; I feel like my sense of time is wonky, and I lose focus and get distracted and disinterested even with things I’m doing for fun. I feel restless and I don’t like where I am, but I can barely bring myself to do anything about it. I’m frozen in place by fear of the unknown and anxiety about what will happen. I’m scared that I’ll just fail again and waste even more money and time and continue to feel like an utter failure. 

**Current Plan:** I took on too much before. I was drowning, but I told myself that I could breathe underwater. I’m trying to be realistic now. I’m trying to resist the impatient and ambitious part of me that wants to DO ALL THE THINGS and do them NOW. I plan on focusing on just finishing a single major and getting my bachelors degree (History). Maybe I’ll do a minor if I can swing it. I hope that starting somewhere new will help as well since I won’t have as much baggage. 

I’m enrolling in a local community college for this spring to take a class or two, but I don’t think that will push my GPA above 2.0 after one semester. However, there is only so much I can do at a community college at this point since I’ve got a lot of my general education requirements out of the way already, and so I would prefer to transfer to a university soon (preferably back in New York since I don’t want to stay in Texas). Alternatively, maybe I could do an associates, and then transfer to a university with that on my transcript? This is terrain that no one I know has charted, so I don’t know how some of these things work. I’ve tried looking through reddit but haven’t found anything specific to my needs, of course.

**Questions:**
1. Is it possible to transfer to a university with a cumulative GPA below 2.0 but recent coursework showing improvement? (In general; I know every school is different)
2. When transferring to a new university, how are credits and GPA applied? Are only grades above F accepted, and it’s effectively like the fails never happened to your gpa?
3. If I can’t transfer to a university yet, would it be best to take more classes at a CC until my GPA improves, or get an associates and then go for a bachelors?

Edit: formatting","[""1. Most universities won't let you transfer below GPA of 2.0,or less than 30 credits. Mine won't let you transfer with a C- in any classes. \n2.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**1.** **Knock-Out technique**

The harder and more distasteful a task is, the better it is to do it immediately. This way, you're not lingering on the thought of doing it while doing some other stuff, so it's better to just get it out of the way ASAP.

**2. Worst-first approach**

Take your pick of the most bothersome task on your list and attempt that task first to get it out of the way. Removing this barrier will help free you up to do the rest of your tasks.

**3. Remember-forgetting technique**

Whenever you remember forgetting to do as task you have been procrastinating on, do it - at least some of it - immediately.

**4.** **Bits and pieces approach**

Do anything in connection with the task you want to accomplish. Gradually do more and more until the task itself doesn't seem so impossible to do. This approach is good for getting started on tasks or activities which are quite large and overwhelming or a bit stressful. The approach helps you to break the ice and get things going. Don't worry so much about getting the job done the right way.

**5. Salami technique**

List all the different steps you have to take to complete a job. Concentrate on taking the first step, then the next, and the next, until you complete the full journey.

**6. Five-minute plan**

Take a task you've been procrastinating on and work on it for a minimum of five minutes a day. Once you've finished five minutes, then you can set yourself another five minutes, and then another. Getting yourself going is frequently the key.

**7. Switching**

This technique helps you to use the momentum you gain from working on one activity and switch over to another less attractive task you've been procrastinating over. Rather than rest, use the energy you still have to switch over to a more onerous task.

**8. Referenting**

Make a list of all the good things which will happen if you stop procrastinating on important tasks and of all the miserable results of your procrastination in the past. This technique is particularly effective if you want to gain control over some strongly ingrained habit such as drinking, smoking, over-eating, or excessive partying.

**9. Premack principle**

The Premack principle states that people are more likely to engage in low probability behavior (say, hang up clothes when arriving home), if what immediately follows the low probability behavior, that is, something which they enjoy and engage in often, such as having a snack.

**10. Getting a round tuit**

Just get yourself a round tuit and get on with what you need to do already  *-\_\_-*

**11. Face the music**

Procrastination can be self-perpetuating when you find it hard to admit to yourself and to others that you have been delaying something which you said you would do. However, when you eventually face the music and tell them about your problem, the criticism and pain that you predict will actually be less than more.

**12. Swap out technique**

Arrange to swap problem-solving help with someone rather than procrastinate when you hit a problem you're taking forever to solve.

**13. Peak performance time**

Schedule the task or activity you have been putting off at a time when you are most alert, rested and energized.

**14.** **Do it, Delegate it, Ditch it**

The idea behind this technique is that you will procrastinate less often if you leave as few loose ends as possible from one day to the next. Instead of getting into the habit of leaving things until you get ""around tuit"" or putting things away temporarily, it is a good policy to deal with things immediately.

**15. Establish priorities**

Sort out the most demanding tasks that are due earlier from the ones that don't require as much effort and/or are due at a later time.

**16. Establish a set time to begin your work**

Pretty self-explanatory. Try to choose a time where you won't be tired and prepare to get started on doing stuff at that time. Peak performance time definitely helps here.

**17.** **Change your environment**

Sometimes, making simple changes to your environment can help you give up bad habits. Study in the library instead of your bedroom, clean your shelves, move your desk someplace else, etc.

**18. Isolation**

In some cases, it is better to get away from social distractions to help us focus on the tasks at hand. Keep your smartphone away, lock your door, go the library, and/or do other realistic things to minimize your distractions.

**19. Visible reminders**

Display a small or large sign which will remind you that there is a demanding task to be done. Post-it notes are one of the more conventional ways to do this. You can also set alarms to remind you of a certain task to scare you into finishing it sooner.

**20. Monitoring**

From Richard Bolles', ""What Color is Your Parachute"":

*""Decide whom you know (spouse, roommate, friend, etc.) that you can take into your confidence about this. Tell them what you need to do, the hours it will take, and how much you need them to keep you at this task. Then put down in your appointment book a regularly weekly date when they will guarantee to meet with you, check you out on what you've done already, and be very stern with you if you've done little or nothing since your previous week's meeting. The more a taskmaster this confidant is, the better.""*

**21. Guided imagery**

The key to using visualization successfully is to form very vivid and real pictures of you completing a task using as many of your senses as possible. Visualize every aspect of the activity and you getting it done.

**22. Rational-emotive imagery**

Form two separate images related to the task which you are putting off. First, imagine yourself very uncomfortable and resistant, nervous and uptight. Get in touch with these daunting feelings. Secondly, imagine the same scene and task, but imagine yourself doing the task confidently, comfortably and well. Now that you have been able to change your feelings, reflect on how you were able to achieve this.

**23.** **The Catastrophe scale**

Think about a time when you are procrastinating something. At the time you are putting it off, how bad is it for you to have to do the task on scale of 1 to 100 where 100 is the worst thing in the world and one is the most favored. Think of a number between 1 and 100. On a scale of world catastrophes, where would you put having to do the task you've been putting off? When most people apply the Catastrophe scale to their procrastination, they can see that they have been blowing the unpleasantness of having to do the task that's at hand WAY out of proportion.

**24. Paradoxical intention**

Here's two suggestions: Procrastinate to the best of your ability for a week. Continue to put off as many important and unimportant jobs and activities as you can. Observe your procrastination for a week. Keep track of how often and for how long you procrastinate at different tasks. Keep careful recording of what you procrastinate on, where and for how long.

**25. Behavioral self-control**

* Goal-setting
* Self-observation
* Environmental control
* Self-rewards/self-penalties

How To Be A Good Roommate??,4,cjxsxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cjxsxu/how_to_be_a_good_roommate/,3,"this kind of sounds like a stupid question but im so paranoid my roommate is going to hate me! i keep on seeing posts on how to deal with a terrible roommate but im worried that i will be that terrible roommate!

the roommate in question is actually a good friend of mine but we dont rlly talk a lot. i was wondering if u guys had any rules to follow to make sure ur not intruding on ur roommates space/doing anything to irritate them? 

some specific things that has me worried is that i pray 5 times a day (try to at least lmfao) and idk the room is kinda small and im worried she’ll think its kinda tiring or smth since like ill prob take up most of the floor space. and my sleep schedule switches up a lot n i wake up around 6 am everyday but i usually stay up n i go to bed rlly late. the problem is that i have to use like 10 alarms at a minute interval (like 6:00, 6:01, 6:02, 6:03...) and use different alarms on my phone since i can sleep through everything especially when im some place new. last summer at a college program, my alarms didnt even wake me up. they woke up my roommate who then had to shake me awake. im sure that will get annoying quickly but thats how i wake up until a month-ish and i get used to it. also she knows im kinda that loud friend (not rowdy, i just talk louder than most people) but?? how do i fix this? ive been trying to soften my voice but im worried its not enough! alsooo my mental health has always been terrible but i think i have seasonal depression? im always feeling very depressed around fall/winter and im so worried its going to be worse for me since i feel like i would try to hide it from her? my attempts at self care are kinda rlly destructive lmao but im planning on using my school’s DRS but yeah im rlly worried m gonna like. not be a good person to be around in addition to probably slacking on my part in term of making sure the room is clean. this is a lot and im kind of just ranting about my worries but she asked to be roommates with me and i dont wanna make her regret that decision. i get that a lot of that probably involves communicating with my roommate but im unable to reach her until school starts and i have of history of getting anxious and ending up not saying anything.

so yeah, any things to keep in mind when having a roommate and anything that could help w my situation?

thanks for reading and any advice! its very much appreciated :)","[""From the start be straight with them. If either one of you has a problem with each other they should be the first one to hear about it. You don't go off and tell your friends, dorm neighbors, or the internet. You talk to your roommate and tell them what's bothering you and they do the same to you. Most problems won't magically go away. \n\nIf your roommate says you're doing x too much or too loud or whatever agree on a new standard and do your best to meet it."", 'Two words: Roommate agreements. Near all housing communities at colleges should mandate that you have one written up the first few weeks of school. This is basically a rough outline that details rules over things like sleep schedules, visitors in the room, noise levels, etc. If your college/RA doesn’t mandate that you have one, MAKE ONE for the two of you yourselves. These are a huge help in seeing where you all are compatible on things and not on others.\n\nOther than this, you should be free to do anything within reason so long as you let your roommate know. And if you’re EVER having an issue, bring it up to your roommate first and foremost then the RA.', ""First: communicate. If something is bugging you or her dont let it build up. Solve the problem as soon as possoble.\n\nSecond: be clean. Dont leave your stuff in her area and clean up after yourself. Nobody likes the roomate who doesn't do dishes\n\nThird: dont be noisy. It's okay to be loud at times but keep it down if she's busy studying or it's late at night. \n\nForth: leave the dorm, everyone likes some privacy to do... stuff... hanging around constantly can feel overwhelming. Go out on Friday nights or just leave the dorm to her every once in while so she wont feel suffocated. \n\nFifth: Setup some rules or agreements. It does wonders to setup a system to who cleans what and when. We had a rule that someone would buy the toilet paper for the particular month. We never ran out of TP and never argued.\n\nSixth: use some common sense. If it seems like something is annoying them, ask them. They may feel like they cannot talk to you about something.

Exam Day Ritual,2,avnxt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/avnxt3/exam_day_ritual/,7,"What is your ritual or routine for exam days? 

Most of my exams are in the morning, so this is how I do exam days:

On the day of a big exam I will wake up extra early. I drink a glass of water then take a shower. I change into sweat pants and a sweater and brush my teeth. 

While my hair is drying I will review notes and collect everything I need for my test (mechanical pencils, calculator, note card, notevook, hair tie, water bottle, caffeine, mints).

After my hair is dry, I put on a full face of makeup (I don't usually wear makeup, but I wear it for tests because it reduces my anxiety).

I get to the testing center a half-hour early, then I go over my notes while drinking my coffee/ energy drink. 
If I don't do these things, I find it harder to focus during the test, and end up getting a worse grade because of it.

After I finish the exam, I try not to do any related course work, as it psyches me out, and end up with a lot of post-test anxiety. 

TLDR; I want to know your test day routine. Mine is basically a methodical, self-care oriented approach to reducing stress pre and post test.

And always make sure your financial advisor is a fiduciary, so they are obligated to act in your best interests. But even that isn\'t super important if you don\'t already have a bunch of money to manage. ']",3/1/19 5:38

Community College vs. 4-year University,19,imik4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/imik4p/community_college_vs_4year_university/,19,"What would you say are the pros and cons of both? What would you recommend from your experience? Tips?

Bit of background: I am a person who has maintained great grades throughout high school but don’t care too much for the college experience of dorm or party life. Up until now, I was heavily considering a gap year to try to focus on some self growth and to develop experience beyond the books. I have pretty bad social anxiety when meeting new people so I feel it is optimal to tackle this hurdle now than never. I regret not focusing on managing my social anxiety better throughout high school through more social exposure and experiencing rejection. With this, I don’t want College or University to be an overwhelming experience especially when I currently don’t feel emotionally ready even though I’d be fine academically. Being away from close friends plus withdrawing into isolation doesn’t seem appealing.","['I attended community college and transferred to a 4 year after completing my A.S. I\'m entering my senior year of undergrad now. I was just like you!! Not /totally/ sure what I wanted, definitely not into partying, etc. Etc.... community college was the best decision in my entire life!!! I loved it there. In my experience, people who go to CC are people who *want* to go to college. Maybe they didn\'t have the grades or money, but they still want it. Or maybe they\'re unsure of what they want or they are starting school again after a long break off. I never met anyone at CC who was there because they felt obligated to be.  There\'s a lot of people going because they are older and always wanted to have a degree for themselves, even if it not to further their career. \n\nAt my university, there\'s a lot of students who are going because they wanted to get out of the house or wanted to move, party, told they needed to go to a 4 year or whatever...It really changes the vibe. There\'s a lot of students there whose primary motive is something other than wanting to go to college. \n\nI met some of the most interesting people ever at community college and some of the hardest classes I\'ve taken in undergrad were there!! It\'s a great environment to explore your interests in a general degree before committing to a major at a 4 year and to get to know yourself. I would not be where I am if I hadn\'t gone, and I think I\'m in a really good place. \n\nAt one point, I was staying an hour or more after every one of my classes to talk to a classmate who was 80 years old, taking the same class every semester (she\'d fall ""ill"" or get ""hurt"" the last 2 weeks every time and thus not get credit so she could take it again. She loved it that much). Not that people like that don\'t go to universities, but I have seen much less there. The age, lifestyle and motivation diversity at my community college made it, in my opinion, my most valuable educational experience.', 'I would not take a gap year, you lose so much knowledge in that amount of time.', 'It really depends on the community college and your personal goals. Some CC\'s are better than others, and can be great places to get cheaper gen ed classes out of the way before transferring. The CC I attended was honestly a glorified high school. Sure, it was nice to save money, but I didn\'t learn any of the necessary skills for university. The advisors were shit, and few professors cared. There were so few options for majors that there was no way to explore what I wanted to do. To be clear, not all CC\'s are like this, so do your research and talk to the students.\n\nWhen I transferred I was thrown right into being a ""freshman"" again, but also expected to know everything about everything because I was a junior. I wasted 2 semesters trying to figure out what I wanted to major in because I finally had options outside of the basic: STEM, history, english, nursing, and education. The field I chose to go into pretty much requires research experience in order to go to grad school if you want any kind of career at all. But because I came in as a junior, none of the professors knew me and wouldn\'t let me join their labs. It also made it harder to get rec letters for jobs after graduating. \n\nThe one advantage I had with community college, besides saving money, was getting to take public speaking with a smaller class size. At CC it was a class of 15. At the uni I transferred to it would\'ve been a lecture hall of 150. \n\nIf you want to go to CC first, you do you, save money, figure things out. Just do your research first and make sure it\'s a good place that will prepare you for university.', 'I’m similar to you and did CC and then transfer. Honestly think it’s the smartest way to go for anyone unless you: \n\nDid so well in High School that you can go to a very competitive university that you might not get into after CC (because then you’ll have to do really well in CC too) or if you want that “college experience” which will be nonexistent until this pandemic stuff ends.', ""I waited from 17-22 to go back to school and it heavily benefited me. You don't have to take that long, but if you think a gap year would be good, do it! I'm at community rn and i'll tell you I have the same professors as at the universities, but I pay like, 1/6 the cost. And its smaller class sizes with easier interaction with professors."", ""Please, TAKE THE GAP YEAR! If you're unsure of how you're feeling, take the gap year to figure yourself out. You've spent your entire life in school, if you have the chance to take a breather, take it! I so wish I would have; i wasted an entire year of school because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I'd recommend take the gap, begin at a community College, and transfer to a 4 year if you decide you want to do it! You have plenty of time to figure it all out."", 'Are your close friends going away to college? If so, staying home doesnt mean they will be geographically close. \n\nMy child with social anxiety chose a small tech school (with a dorm) in a smaller town.

The tech school had smaller class sizes and he felt he was well supported and liked his instructors. He is earning his associates degree in a healthcare field of which there is not a bachelors equivalent. After that he may choose to continue on if he wishes. He has matured and grown so much in the last year its been the perfect solution for him.', 'Pros of CC\n\n-Less Money\n\n-Smaller classes \n\n\nCons of CC\n\n-Harder to have a social life on campus\n\n-Less resources than 4 year Uni\n\nPros of Uni\n\n-Social life is better\n\n-Classes are bigger (for shy students that don’t like being on the spot)\n\n-More resources to take advantage of\n\nCons of Uni\n\n-Expensive asf\n\n-Might get homesick', 'If you have the option of taking the gap year I would heavily advise that to figure out what you wanna do. For you I think community college would be a great fit. Community college is the easiest and hardest place to meet people. It’s the easiest because the class sizes are so small you’ll usually form a bond with your classmates. It’s also the hardest because, at least for me, it seemed like nobody wanted to be there and raced home immediately after class not leaving a huge opportunity meet new people. Community college is also nice because you aren’t going to be in massive debt because of it.', 'What\'s your ultimate goal? ""Going to college"" is fine, but what do you want out of it? \n\nThe reason I ask, is because at CC we get students who don\'t have a plan beyond ""go to college"". Most people who go to community college want a Bachelor\'s degree, which almost always means they\'ll have to transfer to a University at some point. \n\nWhen you transfer, though, it\'s not always an easy and simple process. To avoid problems, it\'s helpful if you already know two things:  what degree you ultimately want you pursue and what university you want you transfer to. \n\nFor my CC, if you know both of those things, we can advise you with exactly what to take. If you know one of those things, we can get you the first year (30 hours). If you don\'t know either, we can get you only one semester of credits that will (almost certainly) count. \n\nBut every state and locality is different. If the state, universities and CCs were all working together well, this would be easy. Unfortunately, higher ed is filled with amazing red tape and the students are the ones who pay the price the most.', ""As someone who went to a Community College than transferred to a 4 year after getting an Associates. It worked really well for me since it was cheap and the gen ed classes were pretty easy. I also didn't know what I wanted to do until the semester I got my associate's. Check to see if the 4 year colleges around you take the community college credits. Also if you have a career path you feel like you want to go on it would probably be better to go to a 4 year. Edit: fixed grammar since well there's a reason I'm not an english major."", 'Often, the stigma of a community college alone is the only con that matters to some people. People are quick to judge and group those who don’t care much for school and only partake in for parties with those who are unable to afford college/didn’t get into their main choice, or wasn’t the right time. \n\n\n\nCC is great in so many ways financially and can potentially put you in a better spot if you decide to focus up, but it can be difficult to go about two years of it while friends are off at their universities.', 'I’m a CC student who felt the same way you did. I’m so glad I chose the CC to 4 yr route. I also wasn’t ready to go off on my own yet and I wanted a less expensive education. Luckily my CC is one of the best in the nation, so my quality of education is on par with a 4 yr. \nPros:\n-less expensive\n-with everything online, you aren’t losing much $ since tuition is very low \n-professors are generally good\n-a lot of support services for students and transfer opportunities\nCons:\n-it can be a drag especially if it takes longer than 2 yrs to transfer (friends come and go a lot each semester, they don’t stick around like ones at a 4 yr. the campus may become boring\n-living at home (can be a + or minus, for me it started as a Pro and became a Con)\n-harder to adjust once you transfer to a 4 yr to make friends and get experiences like lab research unless the 4 yr school is smaller\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I’d chose CC because it was the best option at the time. It still is for me now, but for various reasons has become more of a drag (My situation is unique so I think it probably won’t for you). Considering the uncertainties of the pandemic, I’d say go for CC or gap year, just make sure you have something to show for your gap year. Unless you have strong self discipline and/or a plan for your gap year like a program, I’d advise against this option. However, for some it is great so decide for yourself.', ""I attended a community college. I enjoyed it, but it definitely doesn't have the same social atmosphere as a 4-year school. I have social anxiety as well. I also had good grades in school, but for various reasons I needed to stay home. Most of my friends from high school left to go to 4-years. So I was isolated by staying home and going to a CC. That said, I enjoyed my time and I got a great education. I just transferred to NYU and I love it so far. I was worried at first with my background, but I feel more prepared for every aspect of NYU (the academics, the social networking, the career networking, etc...). \n\nYou know yourself and if you feel that a 4-year isn't the right move right away, you should listen to that instinct. It also has the added benefit of saving a TON of money! Just make sure it is really what you want. Maybe work a bit and travel a bit, if you can/if you want to.\n\n That's part of what I did during my time at CC. It allowed me the space and lack of pressure to explore and figure out what I really wanted. I am very happy with where I am now and I wouldn't be the same without that period of time at a CC. Maybe also consider a gap year. I travelled Europe during a gap year and it changed my perspective and my life trajectory. You can do whatever in your gap year. Schools will not look down on you for that, and may even appreciate your added life experience. And despite what you might feel (I felt that way in hs), there is not a rush to get through school right away or know what you want to do right away or know what you want to do forever and ever. That might be how it seems with societal pressures but it isn't true. You can be amazingly successful and happy forging your own path. So give yourself a bit of time to figure out what you want to do FOR NOW: for the next year, or even the next 6 months, and go from there.""]",9/4/20 19:58
Considering changing my major,4,j3dugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j3dugs/considering_changing_my_major/,5,"This is a huge worry of mine. I came into my first semester with 30 college credits due to dual credit in high school. I say this to emphasize the fact that while this is my first semester in college, I am technically at sophomore level. I am a biology major on a Pre PA track (im also second guessing if i should just go all in and focus on med school-another story) and this major allows me to finish with a bachelors in biology.

I have always been indecisive- thats just me. I am enneagram type 4, which if you care, means that I am driven by emotions more than logic, and that I MUST find my meaning in life. That being said, I expect to fall in love with my career. But I'm terrified that whenever that epiphany happens where I discover what I am meant to do with my life will be too late. I am so worried because the other major I am considering is such a complete 180. But for as long as I can remember, my main interests have been history and science.

Here are my personal pros and cons of going into the field of law:

pros: I have always seen myself as a lawyer. History is one of my favorite subjects. I also find government very interesting, but not enough to go into politics (unless you wanna talk about campaign managing, that sounds like something I could get into). I LOVE english. By this I mean I love finding errors such as an incorrect you're vs your etc. I love it. My asthetic is dark academia. I'm currently sitting in my most favorite library: the quietest, most architecturally unique building on campus (which just so happens to be the law library) and I could sit here for hours just reading. It is the same way with museums, I could spend an entire day there.

cons: Writing papers is probably my least favorite thing. And public speaking (you're probably going to roll your eyes) is not my strong suit, I get very nervous and don't have the self confidence of lawyers on tv. Thats the other thing, when I say lawyer I dont mean the small town lawyers who cover small issues and never go to court with a jury. I've shadowed that type of lawyer and couldn't stay awake.

My University doesn't have a major for Law, so I can major in anything and just make sure I take the required courses needed for law school. Which is a relief and a half, but this would mean I would be taking heavy biology classes and adding history courses on top of this.

Don't get me wrong, I think science is incredibly interesting. Since 6th grade when I started shadowing at the local vet clinic, I knew I loved science. After I got used to them, I could watch surgery all day long. And they even taught me how to suture on a banana. I was so proud of my suture job that repaired bananas sat in my freezer for weeks. Don't let my username fool you, I haven't had chemistry in college yet, but it was a complete weakness in high school.

&#x200B;

tl;dr- I am a bio major questioning if I should go into law.","['The great thing about Pre Law is that you can still be a biology major and take the LSAT. There are no specific prerequisites to being admitted into law school other than the LSAT. (Unlike medical school which would need biology, orgo, and everything else.) So if biology is your passion, you can continue to pursue it and decide later on in the future. You would not need any additional history/political science/etc. courses.', ""You have a long time to figure it out but there are no required courses for law school. Also, there are lots of types of lawyers and most lawyers do very little public speaking, though most  do a good amount of writing. I think shadowing a lawyer sounds unbearably boring because you can't tell what's going on because it's just someone sitting at a desk most of the time, but that doesn't mean actually being a lawyer is boring.""]",10/1/20 22:06
I have to choose a major soon and I think this is the right place for some advice (tl;dr at end of post),1,j9nmne,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j9nmne/i_have_to_choose_a_major_soon_and_i_think_this_is/,3,"So for some context, I’m a sophomore college student at UMD (college park) with an undecided major and minor. I already have all of my gen-eds out of the way (besides one, but that’s professional writing and is major-based). Registration is coming up and I just feel like I’m stuck in a rut. 

While I used to be contemplating majoring in upwards of 10 different majors, I think I got that number down to 2: (1) Hearing & Speech Science with a minor in vocal performance and (2) architecture (with a minor in sustainability maybe??)

I know these fields are COMPLETELY different, but it’s just what it’s come to. 

I absolutely LOVE to sing and my dream job is to become a vocal coach and help people learn how to sing in a healthy way. However, with this job, it’s most always self employed and there are no benefits. So that’s why I would major in Hearing & Speech Science (HESP). With HESP, I can become a speech pathologist and (hopefully) specialize more in the voice and how to use it correctly. While there are people who do this, it’s a pretty rare job and I feel it would be hard to find a job. So I feel like I would be stuck with a job in speech pathology (possibly helping people improve their speech) while I would rather be focused on the voice. With the minor in vocal performance, I feel I can bring extra skills to the table and that could help me secure a job in the more vocal therapy field of speech pathology. Also, I love to sing and it’s truly what I’m passionate about, I just don’t know how viable the career option is. I’ve heard speech pathology is a growing field, but I just don’t want to be stuck at a school working with children with speech disorders for my entire career. I wouldn’t **mind** it, but I would rather do something voice based. (also note: I think some jobs within HESP require grad school- I’m not against that idea but I would rather not do it. Of course if it comes to me having to do grad school, I won’t be mad, it just means more money in student loans to pay off).

So the other option is architecture. Over the years, I’ve taken many architecture classes and honestly, they haven’t been too bad. I love designing things such as houses, and if I *do* end up going into architecture, I would want to do interior design and maybe link it to some type of environmental thing. (I know that’s vague, so sorry haha it’s just an idea in my head). While having a job in architecture will give benefits, I just don’t know if I’ll truly be happy. Don’t get me wrong, I love designing things and being creative. But the thought of me possibly doing something I would rather enjoy would eat away at me.


I feel I’m getting mixed messages to everyone I talk to. While some say to do a major in architecture because I’ll be safe financially, I am very tempted to major in HESP. The thing is that I don’t feel like I *have* to make a ton of money though. I would rather be happy doing what I love. I guess I just don’t know how important benefits are, and if it’s okay to live life without them. Not to mention, there *are* benefits in speech pathology. It’s just private vocal coaching where I would be on my own.

So I guess I’m just making this post for some advice. I feel like this is such a monumental decision and it’s hard for me to choose. I just want to be fulfilled with what I do in life, but I also want to be able to afford a decent house. I really don’t care about money that much, as long as I’m happy. I keep thinking about the quote “if you love your job, you never work a day in your life” and I think that’s extremely important. I’m getting mixed messages because I’m definitely giving off mixed messages. I’m a very indecisive person, for example I waited until the last month until I chose what college I wanted to go to. 

Okay this post is long and I’m sorry. It’s 5 am and I just feel like this is the place to go. So please, if u have ANY advice, even if it’s just a sentence, that can help me. Thanks so much, and I hope you have an awesome day/night!! :)

(note: the reason I didn’t flair post as USA is because I think anymore can have good advice regardless of country bc this is definitely more of a universal idea).


*tl;dr*

I’m choosing between Hearing and Speech Science (HESP) or Architecture as a major. I’m a sophomore in college and if I want to graduate on time, I have to choose soon because registration is coming up. I don’t know if HESP will help me in the future financially as well as architecture can. I enjoy both fields but feel I will be happier doing HESP (specialized more in voice). My dream job is to become a vocal coach which is most always self employed. I just need advice. thanks!","[""If you can manage the workload you could double major or major and minor. \n\nMajor and minor for most people. \n\neither major, it'll be harder than usual to get a job. they're very saturated and low openings as well as competitive and almost no not much job security. so I'd think it's best at this point to do what you'd want to do more.

College Essay about Mental Health?,3,95tscr,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/95tscr/college_essay_about_mental_health/,8,"Hello! 

I’m (F/16) gonna be a high school senior in less than a month. So asides from FAFSA and keeping my grades up and all that jazz, there’s the college essay. I’m going through a really tough period mentally and emotionally, but these months are also what motivates me even more to become what I want to be (I wanna be a psychiatrist). 

Obviously, because I think that me dealing with my mental health issues by getting a therapist and what not has changed me a lot, I plan on writing about my experiences and all that. The thing is that there are lots of sites where they discourage people like me to write about such a heavy topic, which both disheartens and infuriates me. It makes me want to write about how I struggle with my illnesses on a daily basis, but still persevere. 

I just wanted to ask, how do I go about writing such a heavy topic without sounding so melodramatic or “too much”? This is something that means a lot to me and I would love it if anyone could give me some advice. 

TL;DR:

I (F/16), am starting my senior year in high school pretty soon. I’ve been dealing with an onslaught of mental illnesses that have kind of impacted my grades (I had around a 95 average at the beginning of junior year, and by the end it was a around a 91) and my overall view of myself and the world. But after finally connecting with a therapist whom I trust, I believe I’m slowly feeling like some form of myself. I want to become a psychiatrist, and I’m passionate in doing so because of my personal experiences and because I love to help people. Naturally, I’ll also be writing my essay on the topic of mental health, though discouraged by college admissions counselors in the websites I visit (IDK if my own will discourage it too, who knows?). 

How do I go about writing it without sounding like I’m incapable of carrying the weight of my undergrad, and eventually med school? I was thinking of writing about self-care, and my struggles with it. I really need some advice. ","['I would have to strongly suggest *against* that topic. \n\nThe problem is that mental health is still stigmatized. It is also greatly exacerbated by stress. In the worst case scenario, your essay on your mental health trouble could convey that you are (a) not resilient and incapable of handling stressful situations, (b) at high risk of dropping out or performing poorly over 4 years as things out of your control will impact you more, and (c) that your motivations for being a psychiatrist are somewhat shallow and misguided. \n\nA *lot* of people start studying psychology because of their own personal experiences with mental health, and obviously very few of them ever become professionals in the field. Psychiatrists have to be incredibly mentally resilient because they end up shouldering some of the problems of their patients. You have to be able to manage your own mental health troubles and that of multiple seriously ill people all at once, and it\'s no easy task. Having a mental illness means you have fewer resources to deal with that stress and you put yourself at heightened risk of relapse. \n\nThe only time where you could really pull off a ""mental illness"" essay is after you already have experience in the field to *prove* that you can handle it. At this early stage, you\'re just conjecturing and *claiming* that you can do it without any proof, and it\'s perfectly reasonable that people might not fully believe you. ', 'Hi there,\n\nI wrote about my experience with anxiety disorder for my personal statement and got accepted to some top schools in the country, here’s my advice:\n1. Don’t go into too much detail; they don’t need to know every single up and down you went through. Just touch on how it affected you (especially academically), how you overcame/are overcoming it, and how it’s inspired you. \n2. Make sure you give them a good amount of time to recover; you don’t want to just plop a heavy subject at the end of your essay, and you don’t want it to come out of nowhere, give it a nice little nest.\n\nMental health is a heavy topic but times are changing and I think your admissions officers will understand that, mine obviously did.\n\nGood luck!', ""By the way, no reason you can't write about it and just not use it for your college essay.  You could do anything with it from put it in a drawer to try to put it on a blog to try to get it published somewhere.""]",8/9/18 9:48
I envy people who really enjoy their major,1,jcc6l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcc6l6/i_envy_people_who_really_enjoy_their_major/,0,"I’m not gonna say I don’t care about my education, but I’m not gonna act like I was ever excited to study my major, or that enjoying learning is what pushes me to do well.  The only thing that pushes me to do well is just because I “have to” do well.

It’s not like I don’t find my major interesting, but i mostly tolerate or don’t mind it. So I envy those who can go out their way to care about their major, to the point of self studying out of sheer curiosity.

Not to say I don’t have passions, but they’re  not college/job bound and the chance of me creating a profitable career out of them is extremely low. So my passions are like side quests right now. So changing my major would be pointless because id have the same attitudes towards it. And I know that’s normal for a lot but...

If I’m not extremely Lucky, I’m gonna spend 8 hours a day for the next 30-40 years working for something I just find tolerable and interesting. And I’m putting my mind on the line for this career in college. The idea of something I only find tolerable taking up a large majority of my life is what makes me envy those who are passionate about their major.  And by tolerable I don’t mean every day I’m gonna go to work and hate myself but still do the work. What I really mean is I’ll probably have days where I love my major and job, but majority of the time will definitely be a “it’s cool but whatever”.


I guess I’ve come to peace with it, but It’s possible to be passionate about your major/career as much as you are about your hobbies or side passions. Especially when that passion is already your career or major. And I envy those people.",[],10/16/20 19:44
Go home or stay on campus?,12,ietp34,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ietp34/go_home_or_stay_on_campus/,10,"It's not official but it looks like my college is on the road to all online classes with the choice of staying or going home. I see pros and cons to both and wanted some input. I'm a freshman currently living in a dorm 1.5 hours away from home. 

Pros to staying on campus:

* Good for staying in productive school mindset --> better grades (?)
* More quiet areas to study 
* Independence from parents --> helping me learn to ""adult"" 
* Easier to discipline myself in all aspects of life (exercise, healthy eating) on campus

Cons to staying on campus:

* Loneliness. I would be alone since my roommate plans on going home if it's online. I don't have many friends on campus and meeting new people is a gamble of hoping they've been careful. Social gatherings are discouraged at this point. I have Internet friends and can call my family to curb loneliness, but still.
* Even though I'm close to home, I'm hesitant to visit family. They insist it's fine and want to visit in-person often (once every 1-2 weeks), but I'm a risk factor coming from a college campus. There's a chance that my school could not allow us to leave campus to control the spread, leaving me ""stuck"" until the semester ends.
* Then of course the risk of getting covid.

Pros to going home:

* No homesickness and less loneliness. Being stuck with my parents isn't ideal but it's not terrible. Gives me people to talk to. I can meet people my age later.
* Less risk of getting covid and if I do, I'll be home and not quarantined at school. 
* Saves money by getting refunds.

Cons of going home:

* I'm scared my grades will slip. I'm scared I'll get into ""home"" mindset and get lazy/unmotivated. I guess that could be solved through self-discipline, but I really don't want my grades to suffer.
* Losing the experience of living in a dorm. I understand that normal college this won't happen this year plain and simple, but it's still ""throwing away"" a chapter of life.

I understand that this is a decision I'll have to make for myself (or maybe even my school will require us go home), but any thoughts are appreciated.

guilt about not trying my best on homework and projects,3,a0xiyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a0xiyv/guilt_about_not_trying_my_best_on_homework_and/,0,"How do you guys find the motivation to try your best and put your best foot forward on projects homework and assignments, when you KNOW you can still pass if you put 20 min of effort in?

I have found myself bullshitting most of my homework these days, and then feeling so guilty about it after, because of my lost opportunity to be conceptual and passionate about the work and benefit greatly from it.

When I start my work, I think to myself ""ok how can I get this done, whats the most efficient way for me to knock this off my to do list?"" And that's a horrible thing, especially since I go to an art school where students are here because they're passionate about their work. But it's still school to me, maybe I'm still stuck in high school mode.

So just for some context, 90% of my homework is week long project style assignments that are due every week and the projects are genuinely really cool. Usually it's a 3D model, or maybe an infographic, a poster, a logo, a painting, etc. Very cool assignments. And I came to this kind of school due to my ability and passion to do creative work.

The problem is I live in a city, in an apartment, have a cat, therefore I'm BUSY. Much busier than my peers who live in dorms and don't have to clean, cook meals, grocery shop, and play more of an adult role. So many of my friends in dorms wake up, school, party, and repeat. I can understand putting so much time into homework in that setting.

I MUCH prefer it this way, thats why I chose this life, I enjoy not being treated like a child, but the problem is when I get assignments for school, I am REALLY good at whipping something up. I'm pretty observant and clever, so I usually know exactly what the professor wants to see, and what I have to do to pass and get their approval. And when I have a free afternoon, when I could be doing literally anything else in the city, (having new experiences, working on my personal projects, running errands), it's really really hard for me to choose to put 3 hours into a hw assignment opposed to 30 min/1 hour

Also, I find myself constantly questioning the reasons behind the things I do. I like when my activities have to do with experiences, self care, or because I'm super inspired to do it. When I think of why I'm doing a hw assignment, the only thought that comes up in my head is ""because I have to, my professor told me to.""

maybe I'm being hard on myself

I have come to the realization that college has done virtually nothing to help me prepare for a job in my field once I graduate...,4,ilu5hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ilu5hj/i_have_come_to_the_realization_that_college_has/,5,"Let me elaborate. I am in senior standing in terms of credits and my graduation date is Summer 2021 (so close woo!) I am at my second college because 3 semesters ago I made the transfer to a better school (which looking back I am glad I did because the school I am at now is more prestigious and cares a bit more about their students.) Anyways... I am a Communications major and would love to go into the Sports Media field once I graduate or even just social media marketing in general. Our school has ""pathways"" you can take to somewhat refine what type of Communications you want to go into (like buisness, media, world, etc.) I chose media. The amount of bullshit classes I have had to take is astronomical and I genuinely feel so unprepared. I've had to take things like food communications, ancient indigenous people communications, and just some weird shit like that. I have knocked all my general studies courses out as well as my major required courses, but now I feel I am scrambling to find something to help me feel more prepared. I found a course in mobile and web design that I will take next semester but it is like the FIRST course I have taken/will take in my college career that I think will genuinely help after college. I'm so frustrated knowing I've literally just been wasting my time in bullshit courses that are required by the university. I'm now gonna have to pile on as much ""elective"" courses in like social media or marketing (if they even have something similar to those) in the hopes I will feel more prepared. I have felt that I've accomplished and learned more by self teaching for this little side sports blog I run and also taking a social media internship with a family friend for a year. Anyone else have this issue feeling like college really hasn't done shit for them but put them in debt and waste their time? I genuinely feel that if I lived in an alternate universe where university degrees didn't define job eligibility, but actual internships and hands on experience did, I would be kicking absolute ass after doing hands on work and whatnot in the time that I have spent trudging along through college. I'm just...baffled, annoyed, and stressed. Ugh.","['You’re treating college like job training. It isn’t.

How do you know you don't like something? Is it fear or is it distaste? Changing your major complications,3,ipyt79,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ipyt79/how_do_you_know_you_dont_like_something_is_it/,2,"This is going to be long so prepare yourself 

I’m 20 years old. I graduated high school in 2018 of June. Ever since I graduated I had literally no idea what I wanted to do, I don’t think I really thought about it too hard or my future because I was so caught up in the present problems. 

When my family and I almost lost our home back in 2008 my mom quickly became a nurse to support are family. I always admired her because of it, and ever since then I always had an enormous respect for nurses, more than I ever had before. I wanted to be one so I could feel proud of myself, maybe even more than actually helping people?

So I decided why not become a nurse? I have no other career path, nothing really seems appealing to me so I’ll just do that. 

I went to a local community college and I only have two science classes left, and only five GE classes to transfer to a cal state. Only two semesters left. I have a 4.0 GPA. I have at least 90 hours at a local hospital that I have volunteered at.

Everything is lining up, taking classes is so incredibly easy for me, I know how to study. Everything else is the hard part. 

The problem for me is that I’m a person that struggles with anxiety on a daily basis, to the point where it makes me inconsistent in what I do. I’ve dropped a semester here and there, I’ve bounced from job to job (part time jobs) because of my mental health. 

Nursing isn’t like that. I can’t take nursing school in parts, it’s fast paced and it’s not something I can drop and comeback to. Once I’m in it there’s no going back.  

This pretty much apples to everything in life so maybe I should just disregard that in my decision making. 

I’ve volunteered at the hospital and I actually liked it, I didn’t LOVE it, but it was cool. I got out of my comfort zone and I loved discharging new moms or taking visitors to see their loved ones or delivering lab specimens. 

Talking to patients and helping them into the wheelchair felt like I had purpose in some ways...however there still is a part of me that felt off. I don’t know where that comes from no matter how hard I think, is it because deep down I don’t like nursing? Or maybe it’s just self doubt? 

No matter what career path I choose I will always doubt myself/be afraid so how I can dissect fear from distaste? 

Ever since the pandemic hit I’ve been questioning everything. I haven’t volunteered since March of this year, and I’ve been way too nervous to go back to the hospital. However there’s this itch that I can’t get away from. Everyday internally something is telling me to go back the hospital.  I just need to be in that environment I NEED to shadow a nurse as soon as possible, and to put more reassurance in what I’m doing-however it's not because I want to help patients, it's because I need confirmation. This might be an alarming wake up call for me. 

I was so ify about the future that I actually dropped my Physio class and thought it’s best to take this time to FINALLY finish my GE classes and take this time to self explore a little bit in other areas. 

It’s confusing, because i don’t know if I can handle this career but I really have no other options it feels like. Nursing is all that I have known for the past three years. It's what's comfortable, the idea of nursing is comfortable, but when I think about actually doing a CNA program or being more involved a wave of fear comes over me. It's hard to image myself as happy if I do nursing, the more I go into it...the more I'm in my head ""no this isn't for me...what are you doing...stop this.""

When I imagine myself actually going through with nursing, taking the TEAs test (basically a test to admit you into a school as an oversimplification) I don't want to do that. Maybe it's out of laziness I thought at first but it's out of a lack of motivation. I just don't know if I can force myself to do this anymore, the conflicting feeling is way too out of control. 

Not to mention I have been in this ""Youre already this far along so keep on going, just finish this"" syndrome. 

There's only two other career paths I see myself taking; business and psychology. But as soon as I think about this then my mind starts over analyzing in shit. Business seems cool and I think it's interesting but an actual career path in business? What even is that? It's so unpredictable. 

Then I think about psychology and I'm unsure about that because I don't know if I want to care for someone's literal mind, the most precious part of someone's being. 

I'm confused. And being in this pandemic makes it worst because my opportunities are limited. 

Maybe I should take a business/psychology class within the same semester and see where that goes? Maybe try a business internship? Read some autobiographies on peoples mental disorders and how it has affected their life? Maybe I could get inspired. 

Maybe I could look around and try to get involved something business related. I've never been this lost in my entire life.","[""> The problem for me is that I’m a person that struggles with anxiety on a daily basis, to the point where it makes me inconsistent in what I do. I’ve dropped a semester here and there, I’ve bounced from job to job (part time jobs) because of my mental health.\n\nHave you sought help for your anxiety? I think you should, if you haven't yet.

You might be happy as a nurse, but you might also be equally happy doing something in business operations or marketing. Every job has pros and cons, and there's no job that doesn't have boring or difficult parts you won't like.  \n\nI suggest you think about your choice of college majors as just a best guess as to which occupation best fits your strengths, interests, and working preferences. If you major in nursing, graduate, find a job in nursing, and decide a few years into your career that you don't really like nursing, you'll be able to find other jobs. You aren't stuck in one career path for the next forty years. \n\n> Business seems cool and I think it's interesting but an actual career path in business? What even is that?

covid and my unrealistic expectations of college social life,12,iex74s,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iex74s/covid_and_my_unrealistic_expectations_of_college/,2,"I don’t know if I’m the only one who’s been feeling like this...

But throughout high school (I’m entering college this fall), as I’ve been becoming more self-aware and realizing that people don’t want to be around me/don’t care about me/don’t think about me/just don’t like me as much as I like them, not even my friends (actually, the fact that all the people in my friend group like each other more than they like me is what’s most hurtful because they actually mean something to me), I’ve slowly been placing more and more expectations on college to be a place where I can finally find “my people.” Aka people who will actually want to be my friends, rather than people who feel obligated to stay friends with me.

However, covid and the fact that we’ll be able to do very little socializing (especially natural interactions, or in settings where we share mutual interests) is throwing a complete wrench into that whole “make new friends!” thing I was kinda hoping for. (And I know there’s online social opportunities, but it’s hard for me to act natural virtually, and literally every time I’m video calling with a group of people, they just completely ignore me when I talk and either don’t listen or speak over me).

I know college life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and it definitely won’t live up to the fantasies we have of it based on movies and books and everything, but I still can’t help but feel like college could’ve been such an opportunity to rebuild myself and fix all the things I did wrong in the past 13 years of social interactions that I’ve had in my public school system. And now it’s just going to be the same, and by next year or however long it’ll take for covid to end, everyone will already have their friend groups set in stone and I’ll once again be this outsider that others reluctantly befriend.

Idk, I’m putting this out there in hopes that I’m not alone, but maybe this is just me being a socially awkward wacko again...","[""College kicks ass.

Basic concepts come easy to me. However, once I got to college it has been total hell, because I never learned how to work. Things came so easy I never had to learn how to learn. Smart is not the end-all-be-all measure of success. Also, I am ditzy, and have been for years. I\'ve realized that brain fog for me is hormonal--getting hormonal birth control helped. For my aunt it turned out to be thyroid issues. You might want to get a health checkup, and see if you have medical issues contributing.\n\nNow, that aside. The things we are called growing up deeply affect us. It\'s great that you understand that, it means you can now work past it. That won\'t be easy, but it sounds like it\'s necessary for you to have a good life. I agree that therapy would be good, but you should also do some research on mental health.

I know you are posting on r/college, and that probably means you *want* to go to college. I suggest starting with community college and going for an associate\'s degree. If you need to get away from home and those toxic put-downs, choose a school far from home--even if it is in the same state.  \n\n\nIn addition, if you don\'t think college is the right choice for you, there are vocational schools, and jobs that teach you as you go along.

One of these times you will make it through and feel more confident about it all. Not to over-do the analogy but body building takes a long time and so does building your brain.

Parents make me feel guilty for wanting to live on campus,25,gxqsqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gxqsqw/parents_make_me_feel_guilty_for_wanting_to_live/,14,"I wasn’t sure if this was the right place to post this but either way I could really use some advice.

I’m (20F) transferring to Florida International University in the fall and I’ve been contemplating living on campus. The cost is not too much of a problem since I have financial aid and I can take out a small loan if worse comes to worse. The campus is 30-45 mins away from my house and I don’t drive nor will I be able to get a car anytime soon so I thought living on campus would be convenient for me. My dad is willing to take me to my classes but I don’t want to put that pressure on him since he already does so much. Plus he hates traffic and I’ve heard the traffic in Miami can get really crazy. Tbh I just don’t want to be a burden.

The main problem is that every time I try to talk to my parents about living on campus, they make me feel guilty and it discourages me from wanting to go through with it. “Don’t go, I’ll miss you too much,” my mom says. “You’ll get distracted and won’t get any work done,” my dad says. They tell me that I won’t be able to handle it and that I’m gonna miss them too much and want to come back home within the first week. This could be true since I’m an anxious mess who’s scared of everything but I’d at least like to try it.

You might just say that I should stay home to avoid student debt and the other cons of living on campus, which is true. But where I live isn’t always great. My parents and brother are mostly the reasons behind my self-esteem issues and anxiety. They always tell me that no one cares about my feelings or opinions and make me feel like I’m an idiot. My brother degrades me and constantly makes fun of me and my physical appearance. My father can be very ignorant and prejudice. There’s a lot more but this post is already long enough. But yeah, to say I want to get away for a while would be an understatement.

Nonetheless, they’re still my family and I love them to death. They’re not always bad, if I’m being completely honest. I don’t even know if I’d be able to take care of myself by myself - it will be very hard at first, I imagine. I’ve become very dependent on my parents. But I feel like living on campus would be a good way to help me gain some independence and prepare me for “the real world.” What should I do?

TL;DR: My parents make me feel guilty for and discourage me from wanting to live on campus. How do I convince them to at least let me try for one semester? And how can I prepare myself to live on my own?

I wake up happy most days, I became more confident and led the life I always wanted to. I still get really anxious when I get a call, but it's a small price to pay.

Need advice on adjusting to the dorms while Autistic,7,i02zad,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i02zad/need_advice_on_adjusting_to_the_dorms_while/,2,"This is a bit of a cross-post , and it's quite lengthy, but I'll include a summary at the end with what I need advice for.

I'm an autistic adult going into hopefully my final year of my undergraduate, and so I decided that in order to focus on my education, to becoming more self-sufficient and more socially active, I'd live on campus. I made that decision before realizing how much the outbreak was going to spread, and luckily my campus isn't in a hotspot, so a few of my courses must run on campus.

Unfortunately, due to a mix of autism, depression, anxiety, I'm greatly worried on how well I will adjust to living in a dorm. My prospective suite-mate is fine with me bringing an emotional support animal, which has been approved by the school, but he's also allergic to it, and that just furthers my anxiety.

My main concerns with living with a roommate stem from a few of the living environments I've grown up in being sometimes abusive, and frequently unstructured and chaotic to adjust to. I worry that having to live with another stranger I will self-isolate myself, and might have difficulty actually taking care of myself physically, emotionally, and mentally, as well as focusing on my academic work. I struggle a lot with interpersonal effectiveness skills, choosing to avoid any type of conflict, and I also only function well when I have a strict routine. I know from experience that I will become more hyperfixated on what my roommates schedule is, and trying to adjust my time around it, that I won't be as flexible with fulfilling all of my responsibilities as a student. Without a proper schedule of my own, I'll eat, sleep, bathe, and clean less often than I should, since I'll be running more-so on adrenaline rather than routine and planning. Even at home, I'll frequently have my routine broken since it's hard to adjust myself to how my step-family do things on a whim, rather than planning it out in advance.

That being said, you're probably wondering why am I even living on campus in the first place? I wanted to challenge myself to be more self-sufficient, as well as have more opportunities academically and socially. One of my friends had also told me it was ""guaranteed"" that I'd be able to request for a standalone single/suite as an accommodation for my disabilities. Unfortunately, I just received a letter than it isn't seen as medically necessary, but I can appeal that decision, so that brings me to these two questions and summary.

**Summary/Questions:**

1) What should I write in my appeal letter to the school's decision to not provide me a standalone single? I fully believe that having a standalone single is a necessity for my effectiveness as an autistic student and taking proper care of my mental/emotional/physical well-being. My mental health makes it difficult to cohabitate living spaces when I feel as if I'm stuck there, trying to adjust to someone else's schedule, without opportunities to unwind after feeling autistic burnout. If I had an escape from social situations, I'd be likelier to engage in them knowing that I have a space to relax and focus afterwards, and I'd be able to set a routine that works for me.

2) Provided I have to live with a suite-mate, what can I do to make it convenient for us both, without feeling as if I'm burdensome? I struggle with interpersonal effectiveness skills, so I self-isolate from people because trying to appear ""neurotypical"" is draining, and I'd rather avoid conflict, even if it's making simple requests.","[""Trust me do anything you can to get a single room. Say covid concerns or tell them that you might have to back out if they can't get you a single room. I've been in that situation with roommates and the only time I could relax was in my car. Also consider now that at some point you're likely to have to quarantine for 2 weeks or so with your roommate""]",7/29/20 19:50
my dad refuses to pay for my college? what should I do for college?,12,gce0rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gce0rb/my_dad_refuses_to_pay_for_my_college_what_should/,41,"I'm 16 in my senior year and I calculated the total cost of my first-year of college to be around 15k CAD. My dad is a gynecologist and makes roughly 600k a year so we are obviously very well-off. He grew up dirt poor in Nigeria and is entirely self-made so he expects me to scrap my way through life like he did. I have around $6000 that I should be able to get from academic scholarships alone but I was basically a cooped up nerd for all of highschool so I wouldn't qualify for any other sorts of scholarships. I should also add the uni I'm going to awards scholarships based on averages in your junior year and I did horrendous on my final exams last year (pretty sure I just don't know how to study for finals because I've always done horribly and the more I study, the worse I do) but it brought my average down from around 94-95% to 91%. Although, that may not seem like a huge jump, so many of the prestigious academic scholarships that would actually make a dent in my first-year costs are reserved for 95%+ averages so you can imagine how crushed I was after the finals. The only scholarships I can find that doesnt look at grade 11 but instead grade 12 are based on final exams alone, not your mark including finals, and because I have a big talent for doing extremely bad on finals, I am out of luck on those scholarships as well. It probably sounds like I just have easy teachers at an easy highschool but most of the people I know perform around the same or only slightly lower on their finals, whereas I always do significantly worse. anyways my problem is my dad won't pay cus he expects me to rely solely on scholarships but i did really bad in grade 11 and i won't get enough money to pay off all my costs. also i'm doing a lot better in grade 12 now with an average of 96% before the whole covd 19 thing (now my average is an extremely inflated 98% due to the easy courseload) and even after having the first round of finals in january i was able to pull off a 96% as of early march,,,, but i know the university doesn't care what my mark now is :/ i also dont have the option of applying for need based scholarships or grants or bursaries because of my family's income so i'm completely out of luck","[""Yeah man, the same thing happened to me. My parents made too much for me to get financial aid but wouldn't help me pay. I did get most of my undergrad covered with scholarships, but if I hadn't I'm not sure I even would have gone to college. Definitely start out at a community college - it will cost you a lot less, and if you improve your grades over the next couple of years, you may be able to get some merit-based aid when you transfer to a 4-year university. Also, there are a lot of smaller scholarships you can apply for online, which usually require you to write some essays. If you can win enough of these, they can really make a dent in the cost of college tuition. If your parents will allow you to live at home while you go to community college, that could also help you to save money. Definitely get jobs - maybe even a couple at once - over the summer, and see if you can handle a job during the school year as well. I always worked two jobs each summer during college - usually one full-time paid internship, and one part-time job in food service or retail. Since my parents let me stay with them over break, I was able to save a lot of money that way."", 'Damn, that really sucks. My parents are immigrants as well, but made money for th purpose of giving their kids the best education', ""I'm with your dad on this one, mate. \n\nDefinitely go for the scholarships, they will help out immensely. My girlfriend managed to get 3 years of education for her honours degree which is incredible.\n\nI'm left with the short stick and there are hundreds of thousands of students who are in the same situation. I know the idea of debt is scary but we're in a society where living is built on loans. You will come out of this whole ordeal a lot more financially aware and tougher."", ""So I don't know how well this will translate across state lines and college campuses, but you could take a community college route.  I don't know if going to community college has a real affect on where you can go after or how your degree will be taken.\n\nComparing year-to-year cost of attendance (costs including tuition, food, supplies, et cetera) for students living with their parents at my state school to my community college is a total savings of $8,000 a year ($12k CC to $20k State).  Of that first year you will be offered $5,500 in student loans in your name only with no help from your parents and the sophomore standing is $6,500 in student loans, junior/senior standing would be $7,500 in student loans. There may be additional scholarships you can apply to but generally those will be one-time awards that you would need to apply to again in future years. Its possible the best time to apply for scholarships has passed for this current year.\n\nYour preferred college may have a transfer student admissions that would ping off your Community College grades instead of your highschool grades.  My personal State University has 3-tiers for 2 years each if the student  is a transfer from a in-state Community College ($2,000/year at 2.5 GPA, $3,000/year at 3.0 GPA, $5,000/year with 3.5 GPA and membership in Phi Theta Kappa). Out of state have different awards but that is beyond the scope of this post. But the real catch on these scholarships is they can only be applied if the student has **only attended community college** and would not be offered if you attend even one semester at a regular university between high school and university. You can [read more about Phi Theta Kappa here](https://www.ptk.org/).\n\nObviously, I cannot speak for your goal schools and what they would offer.

"So, you have no internships or employment this summer due to Corona. What's the plan now?",38,ggivc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ggivc9/so_you_have_no_internships_or_employment_this/,15,"I think we've all seen plenty of posts, here, or on any of the job themed subreddits- /r/jobs, /r/findapath, etc, about how corona has kinda screwed us all over. I'm going to skip my own situation and go to just what can we do that isn't sitting around all summer?

So, what is the plan if this happened? How can we still be somewhat productive and not lose an edge in the job market? So far, my guesses are:

1. Look at my business, and see how I can make it grow; I do have a DBA registered in NYS. A few friends heard I wouldn't be employed and asked if I could start on furniture for them.  As /r/jobs pointed out, even self-employment can be listed on resumes and have a much better effect than a gap. It might be a good idea to see if there is anything you can do along that line.
2. Try to get a good sleep schedule- I will be waking up at 6:30am daily next semester. Best not to sleep til noon all summer.
3. Look at where I struggled this semester, and study up on those areas. Predictably for me, I struggled immensely at writing lab reports, research papers, and trying to understand stats in my first semester as an environ minor, after graduating with an useless associates that actually slowed down my thinking. I might try making a small paper that analyzes the biodiversity and amount of native plants in my Nana's woodlot just to get better familiarity with the process.
4. Try to 'network' and get around to improving LinkedIn
5. My college has announced they're holding virtual employment center meetings throughout the summer, trying to figure out what employment opportunities are left for students and how to manage the corona virus- a lot of people lost their internships. See if your college is doing something similar; even if it turns out to be bogus, it still shows you're trying.
6. NYS may have contact tracer employment opportunities, which allows remote work. No idea where to get them; so far it seems like UofR will be handling it in my region and only giving jobs to those connected to the college. Keep your eyes out! I wouldn't be surprised if other states do this as well.
7. I unfortunately am 21 and still live at home after moving back to study at a college here. It saves a lot of money but I'm not allowed to take any non-remote work. If you are allowed to work in-person, there are still employment opportunities in grocery stores from what I've heard- although expect competition to be a bit tough right now. Just please be safe and healthy!

Volunteering is always a great idea as well! Just uh, right now I don't think there's many opportunities. The few positions left in NY, I'm not allowed, haha. No asthmatics wanted (I'm just barely asthmatic. Enough to get rejected from military but not a big amount, but they take it seriously here). If you are healthy and able to, it is quite possible you can find some wonderful volunteering opportunities that can help your resume, especially if you're going into a field such as social work- people will want to see a student who cares.

When all else fails, if you're like me, you have family who want a lot of stuff done. My to-do list includes renovating a basement bathroom, tiling, installing a new floor in the porch, installing a fence, compost bins, possibly building a new shed, removing a shit ton of bittersweet oriental, gardening, etc.","['Can I mention the fact that Americorps is still looking for people?

Worth taking a small loan to remain at my dorm for July?,6,hcv092,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hcv092/worth_taking_a_small_loan_to_remain_at_my_dorm/,4,"Please hear me out.

Been self-isolated since March for fear of being an asymptomatic carrier. I've been hearing that asymptomatic is rare but I honestly have a hard time believing if it's true. 

Back at home we live with my grandma who is older than 65 and my mom has iron deficiency anemia. They're definitely at risk if the virus were to infect them. I'm scared of returning home even just for a visit only for one of them to start coughing. Aside from them being high risk, I really wouldn't look forward to being in the same house as my dad who has completely unmedicated BPD. 

I applied for the CARES Act for the summer. It takes two to three weeks to process. Only thing is I didn't enroll in summer courses cause nothing they offered was part of my degree plan. I've been spending May and June on campus as my job at the library has partially returned to in-person operations. I have no way of knowing if I'll qualify. So I'm considering taking a small private loan that would only be up to $800 to stay on campus for the rest of summer.

I don't feel like I actually know enough to deserve being a top student (which I am now). I was a mediocre student in school. In fact, during high school years, I became extremely apathetic to life to the point that I failed my last high school year. My apathetic attitude persisted to college (I *really* didn't give a shit. I never even attended classes or exams). But I gradually started caring and that's how my grades changed. I am proud of the attitude change, but I can't be proud of my grades because I don't feel like I deserve them. 

If I get a perfect score, I think that maybe I did so because of luck--the teacher made this exam easier this year. Why was I the only one who got a perfect score?

Roommate uses mental illness to guilt trip me whenever I try to communicate about respect and shared responsibilities. Am I overreacting?,240,f1f1uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f1f1uo/roommate_uses_mental_illness_to_guilt_trip_me/,33,"This post started as me venting to the Notes app on my phone, but I would to know if anyone has been in a similar situation or has any insight into how I can approach this issue respectfully. 

I'm a sophomore living in an off-campus apartment, and this year I moved in with a friend from freshman year. She claims to have a pretty extensive list of *undiagnosed* mental illnesses, including depression, panic disorder, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc. As mental illness is very prominent in my family, I have observed all of these disorders first hand and am aware how difficult it can be to keep up with depression/anxiety alone. She is an extremely social and self-assured person so her behavior isn't necessary consistent with what I have seen from what I've seen in family members, but I'm not going to judge or invalidate anyone's personal hardships. For this reason, I try my best to be accommodating of the struggles she claims to be dealing with. 

However, I am unsure of where do draw line line between being understanding her difficulty in performing daily tasks and falling to a manipulative relationship. I have a feeling that I've shifted towards the latter, but here's my list of generic roommate complaints:

&#x200B;

* At the beginning of the school year **when we decided who would get which room, she demanded to have the master’s bedroom**, gave a strange excuse for why she ""needed"" it, and was unwilling to consider my perspective. I didn’t care much so I agreed (I lived in the old dorms last year so I’m honesty just happy to have air conditioning and hot water) but I did ask her how many days per week she planned on living at our apartment; I live here full-time (including breaks) while she only has class for a few days each week and often goes home when she doesn’t have school. She insisted that she would also be living here full-time (this was a change from her original plan to live here half-time), so I just went with it, but that has definitely not been the case. This is not a huge issue, but it definitely foretold the attitude I've dealt with ever since. 
* **I’ve been managing all of our utility bills since we’ve moved in, and she has never payed me her half** ($700+ at this point). Her parents are paying her rent so I know that I will be reimbursed eventually, but it has still been really stressful for me. At this point I’ve already done everything that I can to make it easy for her and all she really has to do is Venmo me. 
* **She does absolutely nothing in terms of consistent cleaning/maintenance.** I could go on for a while about this, but I'll just list some trends.
   * Leaving dishes in her room for days/weeks/months until we run out of plates, utensils, whatever. We once had a mouse visit us for a little while, and she said it was my fault because I have a sealed bag of clothes under my bed (and not because she leaves food and dirty dishes in her room).
   * Leaving dishes in the sink. I hand wash my dishes after using them, and I don't expect her to do the same, but I would still like to be able to use my sink. 
   * Letting dishes sit in our dishwasher until I do them
   * Putting dirty dishes back in our cupboards (this one really bugs me)
   * Leaving rotting food in our refrigerator until I throw it out
   * I swear, she has not once taken out our trash/recycling (we've been living here for six months)
   * Leaving her clothes in our dryer for days/weeks, preventing me from doing laundry for days/weeks
* **Her boyfriend lives here for days at a time... and they spend those days in front of a very loud TV that I bought. This also considerably increases the number of dishes left sitting in common places, the sink, etc.** **She never spoke to me before this started, and she doesn't need my permission, but in that position I definetly would have definitely given her a head's up. I have absolutely no problem with visits/sleepovers, but its gotten to the point where they monopolize common areas for days and I feel confined to my own room.** 
* This is more odd than it is truly concerning, but **she NEVER knocks before opening my door.** She’s woken me up EARLY in the morning by just unapologetically strolling into my room. I would never do this to her or anyone, so it makes me pretty uncomfortable.
* There was another weird steak of about four months when she would always leave our front door unlocked/ajar at night (and then blame it on me), so I had to make it a routine to always check before going to bed. **She has other strange habits like this that force me to compensate by making adjustments to my own lifestyle.** 
* **She is not at all open to having an adult conversation about my wish to get a pet.** Just to clarify, I would never expect her to take responsibility for feeding/caring for my pet, I am really just asking her to coexist with it (kind of like how I have to coexist with her loud af boyfriend). I love animals and having cats throughout my childhood has helped me a lot with anxiety, but again, she will not even entertain the thought as it might pose a slight/occasional inconvenience to her ""when she has to SEE an animal"" (her words). **This is somewhat understandable and probably appears reasonable to an outsider, but the fact that she is unwilling to explain her reasoning (or even acknowledge my concerns) feels unfair to me and it reflects her unwillingness to listen when I try to communicate.**

I've tried holding off on performing certain chores to see if she will eventually cave, but I have found that she will allow out trashcan to overflow before taking it out. I'm really not sure if she doesn't care or if she just knows that I will eventually deal with it, but I'm not sure how to reason with someone who refuses to hear another person's concerns and uses mental illness as a way to guilt trip others.

Also your roommate might be cruel to the cat and mess it up. You said she leaves the door open she might “accidentally” leave it open and let your cat out.

I have personal experience with this sort of person, namely my younger sister, that used ""mental illness"" as an excuse for everything she did wrong, because it\'s an incredible way to stop an argument. The second you blame a shortcoming on mental health, the other person is effectively disarmed as they can\'t continue being upset with you without seemingly blaming you for something you can\'t control.

If she\'s a freshman, she\'s likely only just turned 18 so it\'s likely she\'s still used to her parents taking her to doctors.\n\nThe fact remains anyone can claim an undiagnosed condition. If they aren\'t displaying symptoms consistent with it, *and* don\'t have any sort of proof from a medical professional, *and* don\'t seem to be trying to obtain that proof while at the same time using mental health issues as an explanation/excuse, **then the onus is not on you to keep giving them the benefit of the doubt.**\n\nWhat your describing just sounds like a teenage girl that\'s living on her own for the first time in her life and doesn\'t care about anything. Maybe her parents never taught her to clean up after herself, maybe she\'s just enjoying not having her parents making her do chores, either way, this is completely typical of teenagers in the freshman year of college.\n\nThere are no *unique* mental health flags here.\n\nTell her to go to the schools Psych department and ask if they do free evaluations for students or something to that effect.

Peers making College Decision HARDER!,1,ghvsa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ghvsa6/peers_making_college_decision_harder/,12,"Alright, so I've been going back n forth between three different universities to transfer to from community college (Just finished my freshman year).  I've recently cut it down to two.  Let's just call them ""SCHOOL 1"" and ""SCHOOL 2""

I was originally leaning to the school (SCHOOL 1) where virtually none of my friends are, mostly because of a program the other school didn't offer (not sure what I wanna major in but it's an interest of mine).  Otherwise both schools offer the same things (though I do like SCHOOL 2's campus a lot more).

My dilemma comes in as most my peers from high school and high school ""clique"" of friends that I still talk to individually, go to SCHOOL 2, which I'm now leaning more towards cause I like the activities, campus, community, and extra curricular stuff it offers.  They are my friends, but a few of them in the group and I really had some rocky times in high school.  I never realized how much confidence I was lacking until I feel the way I do now, like I can do anything, like I don't care, for once in my life I don't freeze when talking to my ""crushes.""  I believe the constant ""roasting"" and bullying by those few people and group slowly made me insecure in high school, and when I split ways with them for my first year of college, I gained my confidence, security, ability to talk effectively talk to the girls I like, and more.

I'm timid about picking that college cause I don't want my college experience to turn out like my high school one, where I slowly/subtly lose my feeling of ""I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!"" I mean one of my goals in college is to find a girlfriend who I genuinely love and can see myself spending my entire life with.  I'm not sure I would be able to do that if I lost the ""me"" i am right now.

However, things are cool between my high school friends and I as of now and we talk regularly.  Idk if my ability to gain confidence, a good mentality, and loss of social anxiety around people I'm not comfortable with was a direct cause of losing negative surroundings, or if it was just me maturing. I don't know if this worry about this possible outcome of me losing my current self due to outside forces should influence where I go to college.

I was dismissed the end of a fall 2018 semester from my state school, due to some major mental health problems(anxiety, self-harm,etc.) not trying to write a sob story, just trying to tell the reality of things. I am in a much better place now after about a year of therapy and reworking how I deal with stress, but while I know I am in a much more stable place, I don't know If I have sufficient enough evidence to show an academic board that. 

I took some classes right after I got dismissed at the local community college, but even then the same problems popped up due to my not addressing my mental issues, and I ended up dropping all but one that I got an A in. I worked for a bit as well, but that ended quickly because once again I had no idea how to process stress in a healthy way. I spent the rest of my time frequently visiting my therapist, learning how to take care of myself, and be an actual functioning person. 

I feel so much better than I did a year ago, and have actual hope for my future. However, I'm wondering if I should even reapply for the fall 2020 semester due to my lack of community college grades, which is usually what they look for. Even if I know I am in a better place, I don't know if 1 written acknowledgment, 1 good grade, and some work history is good enough to show an academic board that. My manager told me he would vouch for my work ethic, but I'm not sure that will matter too much.

Well, I made the mistake of listening to my mom too much when she pushed me to go for a liberal arts college while I was at it, because according to her it would help round out my education and was extremely valuable (more so than a specialization in animation basically).

I thought I would make do, got into one that gives crazy good financial aid, I'm basically paying 6k a year which is insane compared to my other friends in art schools. But as the end of my first year is drawing closer I feel less and less motivated. I thought settling for an Art History/Studio Art double major would keep me happy (as those are the only two things I enjoy) but I can't help but feel like I'm ""missing out"" on a better educational experience.

I don't care about a single one of my classes, even though I tried to pick ones that interested me the most the first year.  So far I've just found contempt for the students here, often extremely rich and privileged (average cost for this college is 53k a year), not very diverse at all (88% white, I'm Asian), and mostly bent on partying their entire college life away.

On top of the fact that the art department here is subpar and very ""anything you make is art"", I don't feel like I'm using the time I could to be preparing for a potential job in the fast-paced animation industry. I considered self-studying animation in my free time here but free time just doesn't exist when your professor assigns an entire book to be read in one night. I just feel like...where else am I going to get this much financial aid? Am I being ungrateful? But I just can't find myself to care about any of my subjects when I would rather be drawing.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

I guess, extremely long question short: Is liberal arts worth it? Or will it be more of the same feelings of useless classes and inflated egos?

&#x200B;

UPDATE 3/10: Thanks for all the thoughtful and sincere answers, after a whole lot of thinking it is pretty much decided that I'm leaving this place, and rather most likely going to a community college while also taking some intensive art programs online from accredited schools! ","['Jump ship before you regredditit.', '[deleted]', 'I majored in a STEM field at a liberal arts school. I got a really good financial aid package too so I feel I can somewhat relate. I feel, being someone in a STEM grad program two years out of college, that my liberal arts experience have been invaluable. Being forced to engage with the humanities/social sciences as an undergrad has really broadened my life perspective, and has allowed me to contemplate intersectional career paths beyond just sticking to an industry job or pure academia. I feel fulfilled in that I can regularly engage with friends and strangers  from all intellectual backgrounds, whereas many of my stem friends are limited to other stem people. I’m not sure if my colleagues who studied stem at stem focused schools can relate too much (generalizing here).\n\nYour case is a little different because you’re  studying an art at a liberal arts college. It seems, though, like you’re more so not interested in your major rather than the school it’s self. Have you taken/seriously considered any social sciences or other humanities courses ? I think the benefit of liberal arts schools, which you can leverage, is that you can select from a wide range of topics to study, and do it for pretty cheap.\n\nI think you’re asking the right questions. Maybe your animation department just isn’t that great. I would recommend perhaps finding a new major, (if you’re worried about employability philosophy or Econ would be a good choice), then contemplate doing an MFA at a better school. \n\nIf this is all overwhelming, most schools will commute financial aid if you don’t attend a semester. So if for example you took the fall off to rethink your decision or apply to transfer, you may be able to get what financial aid that would have applied that fall to a fifth year fall. \n\nBut bottom line, I would 100% recommend liberal arts environment. I think the benefits don’t show too much until you’re in the real world, in which having an intellectually diversified perspective can be beneficial. But if you don’t feel your department is benefiting you, find a new major and come back to animation later.\n\nFeel free to DM me', 'get out of the art industry ASAP.']",2/26/20 21:06

Should I get an emotional support dog?,33,e8tpzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/e8tpzu/should_i_get_an_emotional_support_dog/,14,"Edit: alright so it's a resounding no. Thanks for keeping me grounded in reality, reddit! I'll be talking to my supervisor about maybe switching apartments or just stepping down. Honestly I'm anticipating that the winter break will be restorative and I'll be back to my old self.



Okay, so I am an RA. All I've done all semester is suicide prevention. It's really just a couple of students that are struggling, but it's getting out of hand. Just this last weekend I had to take a girl to the hospital because she was overdosing on alcohol and benzos. I'm also going through a long, drawn out break up. obviously that's not nearly as traumatic, just really sucky.

I have a ton of support from other RAs and college faculty. I am safe, I am not feeling suicidal myself. But damn, i am having a hard time holding myself together these days, I'm losing sleep and I'm skipping meals left and right. Classes are going okay thankfully. I would just like something soft and happy to hold and care for. I'm in the library right now and there are dogs here for the day for emotional support and I had to step away after a couple minutes because I started crying.

My university has already suggested that I get an emotional support animal, so I know they'd be on board. My dad is on board. But my mom isnt at the moment. She raised some good points about how having a dog would make grad school decisions more complicated. It could also get in the way of my studies. 

Obviously the other route would be to just step down from my role as an RA. Either way I want to wait until after christmas break to make these decisions.

Do any of you have emotional support animals? How has that worked out for you?","['As a college student with a service dog for a physical disability (very different thing but a similar enough experience): I wouldn\'t advise getting a dog without very, very serious consideration. \n\n\nCollege with a dog is extremely difficult. Suddenly everyone on your hall knows that something is ""wrong"" with you, and I\'ve been completely ostracized by my dormmates as a result of this for the past two years. Being an RA might reduce the risk of that, but that\'s a different consideration - if you have a resident that\'s allergic to/fearful of dogs, would you still be able to accommodate and assist them exactly as you would another resident? \n\n\nBeyond the social aspect, a dog is a massive responsibility. As a college student, can you afford food, grooming needs, supplies, and veterinary care for a dog? Can you afford the time it takes to sufficiently exercise a dog every day? You\'ll no longer be able to spend all day at the library during finals, stay in bed late after a night of partying, or just have a lazy day to yourself. Some of this is alleviated by getting an older, low-energy dog, but still a major concern. \n\n\nDogs complicate a lot of things about living in college. I\'m trying to plan a trip with friends right now and it\'s hard to look for pet-friendly accommodation. Finding housing with a dog is much harder (which is a huge consideration for your future). Depending on what you\'re pursuing as a career, having a dog isn\'t feasible in certain fields of study - nursing school, for example, requires 12 hour clinical rotations (that are often closer to 16 hours). Dogs are a massive commitment. \n\n\nI would say look into other animals that are easy to care for, first. Speak to your therapist and psychiatrist about their thoughts. If you decide to go the dog route, I recommend adopting an older dog with no known behavioral issues that belongs to a low-energy breed.', 'I would suggest not making a long term, expensive commitment like a dog.  Step down from being an RA.  That is something you can control.    \n\n\nmight also consider another pet like a hamster.  A lot less responsibility and a lot cheaper.  And they’re fun little critters.', ""My sister got an ESA during college so this is my outside perspective. \n\nMy sister got a dog (a puppy) in her junior year of college and he definitely helped her mental state. At the same time, it added a bunch of changes to her routine. She needed to make sure her class schedule could work around taking the dog on walks and making sure he wasn't at home alone too long. In the beginning when he was home alone (even though he was crated), he tore things up and ate things he shouldn't (like blankets, toys, etc.). He got hurt at the dog park and she had to spend time and money taking him  to the vet. She needed to participate in an internship in order to graduate and was not able to bring her dog with her during the internship. Luckily the dog could stay with our parents during the internship but that involved putting the dog on a flight across the country. The dog is a sweetheart and my whole family loves him, but even my sister acknowledges that he has caused her and the family a lot of stress.\n\nI definitely think there are a lot of positives to having a support animal, especially in this extremely difficult environment you are in. \n\nI wonder what your options look like for support? Though you are not experiencing thoughts of suicide like some of your residents are, this is obviously impacting you in a huge way. I know counseling provided by universities often suck, but it can be helpful to find someone you can even just vent to and check in with on how you are feeling on a regular basis. Another thought (and this is something I did in undergrad when I really missed my cats) is to look into local shelters that might need volunteers!\n\nThis is a really hard time of year (the holidays, seasonal depression, not to mention the general stress of being in college) and I can't even imagine the stress of  dealing with your own college life on top of your residents' crises.

He's been absolutely wonderful in helping manage anxiety and depression, and made the times I was alone in the dorm so much more bearable. My only real problem is that he hates car rides and school is a 2 hour drive from home. I can assure you having my cat has made my life immensely better, I have something to force me out of bed when I don't want to, I have to keep my room clean, I've made friends with people who hear I have a cat and ask to see him, etc. The only time my cat's gotten in the way of my studies is him physically getting in the way, demanding attention or sitting on my textbooks or sitting on my arms while I'm trying to write papers. \n\nOther people have pointed out that a dog could be difficult and I generally agree. Cats are pretty self-sufficient and I don't have to take him for walks or outside to use the restroom. If you're able (and not allergic) maybe look into rescuing a cuddly cat for your ESA. Cats are a lot harder to train, but they're pretty damn empathetic (also purring is great for everyone and may be beneficial for your health)."", 'What’s going on with your residents?

I see so many people, youtubers, influencers with big hot muscles (or at least a very athletic lifestyle) and an outgoing competitive persona majored in business or marketing or even international economics

I did extraordinarily bad in high school.  To be frank, I loved chasing girls and getting into trouble.  Just never really cared that much about it (always told by teachers I was smart but lazy).

Starting community college (Associates Degree for Transfer- History), I got my ass handed to me the first semester because I was doing the high school routine (F in Stats, C in English, had no problem with my other 2 classes).  Was at a 2.1 GPA.

Fast forward to 2 semesters later, I just finished my fall semester and was able to pass Statistics (with a C, don’t get too ahead of yourselves), and my cumulative GPA has now flown up to a straight 3.0.

Next semester, my last (knock on wood) before transferring to my state school; I am taking 19 units.   6 classes, only hard one I can see is a Bio Lab.  This is to reach my 60 units to complete my associates degree, so it is unavoidable (will be at 62 when I transfer).  

Now to get to the point: I can’t wait.  Here I am, 2 weeks into break, and I am ready to get on to the next semester.  I’m not worried about taking 19 units as it involves no math.  It’s not a “man, might as well get this over with”, but rather a “hell yea, this is going to be fun to learn a bunch”.  

Shit, would love for my 17 year old self to see me now.

I have classes I like and I feel like I'm doing my work and I'm not stressed academically. I also have a good friend group at school. However, I just feel like I lost a piece of myself since coming to college?

I was very passionate about certain things before college, but my passion has almost completely went away. I don't have a problem motivating myself to do my work and I finish them on time, but when I don't feel passionate? I just do the work to do it and I don't feel like I'm getting at better or anything. I also struggle getting the drive and energy to do hobbies. I either just lie in bed or chill with friends when I'm not doing hw, which isn't bad, but I feel like I should also be taking care of my hobbies since it was something I cared so much about before. Not sure if that makes sense, but its been on my mind a lot.

Edit: I didn't expect this to get this many comments and I appreciate what was said. I think despite my great friend group I feel like I'm not ready to spill these emotions about my lack of sense of self to them. And it would feel weird talking to friends from high school, despite still being very close, because they are so far away and doing such different things. I only have my boyfriend who I went to high school with and a close RA on campus to talk to about these problems I feel.

I have not been expelled, suspended, or even on school probation, however I was told to go on a medical leave by the dean of students office.

As for the law they diverted the case and as long as I pass  periodical drug tests, as well as attend therapy they will drop the charges. Also since I never entered a plea at arraignment, I do not have a record.

I feel like a student in Baldi’s Basics when I do this algebra stuff, any advice?

I’ve never been tested for dyslexia (pretty sure I don’t have that, because I can read) or dyscalculia (which would actually explain a lot).

Do I take a gap semester? I’m so lost,2,dwfsp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dwfsp8/do_i_take_a_gap_semester_im_so_lost/,3,"I feel like my whole life all I have ever done is schoolwork and take care of my family from grade school on. When I first got to college, I was so motivated and always was eager to learn. Right now I go to UC Berkeley and changed my major to something I actually like but I don’t have the motivation to study or pursue any opportunities relating to my field because I really feel like I don’t know myself. Outside of being academic, I feel that I don’t have much to offer skill wise. I don’t have anything that I absolutely LOVE doing and I feel terrible about that. I have never felt passionate about anything other than school and I feel that has hindered my growth creatively. I feel that my desire to become more than just an academic is hindering how I am doing in classes right now because I can’t just focus. I am overwhelmed by the amount of schoolwork I have and have this terrible feeling that I don’t know who I am. I would love to write a novel or become great at yoga or travel the world (maybe WWOOFing) but I don’t have the time because I am always so stressed from schoolwork and it is really making me resent my academics at this point.

I just feel that who I am now is so limited and I thought that I would experience some self-growth at college, which I have, but not nearly to the extent to which I would have liked. I still don’t know myself, I feel disconnected from people and lost when asked about what I like to do. The days are so repetitive here and changing feels impossible if I stay here. I also keep procrastinating and I don’t look forward to going to classes like I used to. I’m not excited for my career like I was last year either. I feel like my mental health has deteriorated and I really need a break to refresh myself, find myself, and then jump back into academics with a good head. 

So basically, I have lost my motivation and passion towards my academics because I feel that I need time to explore myself which I have never really had before. I havent really pursued any of the things I’ve wanted because I feel that I have no time for anything but my academics. School has always dominated over everything in my life and I feel like if I found myself and passions outside of academics, I would be able to return to school with the same love for my major I used to have. I also would just be happier and not in this funk.

Did you go back to college?","[""Hey OP,\n\nI go to berkeley too (first semester transfer), and honestly I think a gap semester would not be a bad idea at all!

The question I have rn, is that whether I made the right decision or not. Whether I fully thought it out or not.

I know that I took careful steps, even going as far as taking a test to determine what major suited my personality and intelligence, and it does say that I am suitable for psychology.","[""Well the thing about a psychology major is that there are more psychology bachelor's awarded every year than any other degree, by far.

This deeply disturbs me, and as a straight male I understand that I could never truly understand the discrimination and prejudice gay people and all lgbtq have gone through in this country, but it still seems like a step in the wrong direction and definitely something that would make sharing a confined space with him for at least a year difficult.

He seems pretty firm about it, but claims he ""doesn't really care"". However, I care if I'm sharing a room with someone who has prejudice against me for my sexual orientation.

As the title suggests , I am struggling with keeping up with the work load due to having a severally mentally ill/drug addicted mother. 3 years ago my father passed away which has caused her condition to worsen- at this point she needs almost constant care which is divided between my self and my older sister. I won’t get to into it but over the past year her mental health as escalated the point that there have been several nights were she has been in a&e , sectioned and has the police called on her which has meant I have had to drop everything at uni and travel home to care for her. Thankfully she is finally getting some help but not only had this caused me to be mentally distracted , but I will want to be visiting her as much as possible which will mean taking time off university. 

As I am really struggling I would really like to let my university know the reasons why I might be falling behind (and not just pretending I constantly have the flu ) - but the thing that is stopping me is that I feel very shameful and embarrassed about my family life. i am worried that if I tell them about my situation and they are not able to do anything about it I would feel like I have exposed my self for no reason.

"Never wanted to go to college. As a Junior, I want to turn my life around.",7,dx8xqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dx8xqs/never_wanted_to_go_to_college_as_a_junior_i_want/,0,"Sorry in advance for the length of this post.

I never wanted to go to college: my parents made me go. While I'd always been kinda smart, I'd always been sort of coasting. My achievement basically sort of waxed and waned with my mood. While I managed to get into the (at the time) number 1 ranked high school (at the time) in my city, it was only because my parents had made me apply. I didn't even want to go to college afterwards, I'd wanted to be a stand-up comedian. Again, I was pressured to by my parents; I ended up enrolling in one of the top undergraduate business schools in the country, but I didn't feel proud or happy: I just felt ""ah shit. Here's another 4 more years of me pretending to care about school."" I heard all these stories in freshman year about my friends who cried when they got their letters. I felt disappointed that I had to go.

So I coasted. And it showed. I'm a Junior now, and my first 2 years were essentially a 2-year long rebellion. I refused to take my classes in the order they were recommended (my school surprisingly doesn't have THAT strict of a policy on prerequisites). I took a senior-level class as a sophomore without the prerequisite recommended just to fuck with my advisor. I spent most of a semester high. It was plain to everybody that I didn't really know if I wanted to be there.

It became the case that my grades were sort of all over the place. If I enjoyed the class, no matter how high level it was, I would get an A or an A- at the very least. If I disliked the professor in any way, I would sometimes just refuse to sit exams or arrive around an hour late just to be obnoxious. So it became that due to a combination of my fucking around and flashes of legitimate effort, I ended my sophomore year with a GPA of 3.03. I got exactly what I put in: a mixture of phenomenal work and a flat-out refusal to do work or show up.

I am currently in my Junior year. Sometime during the past week, I can't exactly pinpoint when, but when I was essentially sitting out of school due to being deathly ill, I took a good, long hard look at my life. Through a mixture of exhaustion and being delirious on meds, I actually analyzed myself truly and self-reflected in a way I've never done. I asked myself: What the fuck am I actually doing? I am wasting a shit-ton of money, and more importantly, my precious time. And, perhaps even more horribly, I was taking somebody else's spot at this university who could or had actual intention to use it and make the most of themselves. I was screwing over some other kid who would be grateful instead of come in with this spoiled brat attitude I had. I made a decision then, that I did want to be in school and to do well at it. I realized I did like a good amount of what I was learning, and my actual gripes weren't with the content of the subject, but rather a rebellion against what I felt was taking away from my time and my own fun, or a rebellion against any professor I disliked.

I'm fucking done with that. I was living like a kid despite being 20, despite being a Junior. It's time to sacrifice my childlike freedom for actually having a frame and actually finding something I could be proud of for once, that I chose to do instead of being forced to do. An adult has to consistently give a shit about their responsibilities, something that I've learned way too late in life.

The semester's basically over. I still have finals, but I believe that I'm probably ending up pulling a 3.0 this semester. The grade itself isn't the thing that concerns me: how do I get rid of this lifelong attitude I've had? I know I have a certain level of smarts and intelligence and I just haven't been displaying that: that is a fucking shame and an insult to the gifts I was given.

I want the final year and a half of my college experience to truly reflect the type of learner and academic that I know I can be. I don't know how to do that though: I've never in my life known how to truly motivate myself rather than just ignoring what I didn't want to do or refuse to do something just because I didn't like the person who was asking me to do it. How can I make myself consistently give a shit, and consistently develop the good habits instead of turning into a party monster anytime I saw something I even remotely found dull for a second?

tldr; college Junior who until like last week did not want to go to or be in college. Smart kid who has coasted all my life. Now I am finally starting to love what I am studying, hate how my behavior and actions didn't reflect the kind of student I could be. I want my last year and a half, for the first time in my life, to actually produce and perform in a way I can be proud of. How do people do it? How do you motivate yourself, or develop the right habits?

I need to turn my attitude around. I want to become the student and academic I know I can be, rapido.",[],11/16/19 19:23
Help for a bullshit math class and a teacher who doesn't care (this is long im sorry.),0,d6rftu,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d6rftu/help_for_a_bullshit_math_class_and_a_teacher_who/,7,"I'm a freshman with a complicated personal situation thats adding alot of stress to my life on top of this, if thats important. 

the only general math class i have to take is a Math115 (intermediate Algebra) course. when registering for classes, this class section was at the best time for me, but teacher was TBA. i looked up all my other professors on rate my professor as i registered and they were all cool so i decided to take my chances. (this part right here was hands down the WORST decision my poor naïve self made.) 

...fast forward to first day of school. i get handed my syllabus, Professor starts explaining how it works and by the end of the class i wanted to puke. my heart dropped and i knew this class would drag me by my hair screaming and crying to the end of the semester. 

the class works like this: 

1) all work is done in ALEKS. for anyone who has been graced with not knowing what this is, its a *VERY* universally hated online math program. ""topics"" are problem subjects inside of a ""pie"" and every ""slice"" of the pie is a subject (real mumbers/linear equations/polynomials/etc.). each slice has varying amounts of topics.

2) every topic has to be completed for you to pass. all 250+ topics. it doesnt matter if you take the paper final and pass. if you dont pass ALEKS you fail. 

3) homework is open in a window of friday-thursady 11:59. you either get 10pts or 0pts. you cant get partial credit. it doesnt matter if you're assigned 32 topics for the week and you do 31. if you dont do 32 you get 0pts. 

4) ALEKS will decide when you need a calculator. also no calculators on the paper quizes ever. 

5) its a M/W/F class. M/W she lectures for 20 mins on a few of the topics then we do hmwk for the rest of class. F we get a 10 point quiz and then group work. in group work we get a packet of unfamiliar problems and we get to teach eachother what to do. (i take issue with this because i have bad anxiety about doing math around people) 

6) if you cant complete your homework you still cant complete those topics. why? well when the next hmwk cycle begins ALEKS locks every unit before it. you have to work to finish early to beable to get to those previous units. 

7) Knowledge checks!!!!! basically, ALEKS sometimes forces you to take a test (that isnt graded for the class by my professor) to make sure you actually learned the topics you completed. if you get a question wrong you have to redo that topic. see 6 for why thats horrible. 

8) if you have less than 4 abscenses you dont have to take the paper final, you can only take the ALEKS comprehensive. when asked about how hard it is Prof deadass says ""oh no one has had to try more than about 5 times."" like...the fuck? 

so. this being said we now arrive to right now. I've talked to my professor 3 seperate times about why this class stresses me out so much, and i ask for just a little bone, just something. maybe an extra day for homework, maybe being allowed to use calculators (im a bit bad at paper add/sub bc i go fast and make dumbass mistakes. i know how to do the algebraic concept but some topics take me hours bc i do small fuck ups), unlocking previous topics so i can be sure im still up to speed, less topics every week (week 1 was 25 tpcs, 2 was 32tpcs, this week was only 13 but they were very tedious and very difficult,), partial credit on hmwk, just...SOMETHING. 

i explained that ive already spent lots of time crying and stressing over this class and its so early in the semester. so she pulls up my student report and saw that last wednesday (week 2) i spent 4.5 hours working, and that i worked on my homwork a bit every single day. she asked me how many credits im taking (15), and when i  answered she simply said that it was my fault im stressed because im probably taking too many classes. i was like??? no???? i need to take 15 a semester to graduate in 2 years (im going for an associate.) i know the content of the class but the amount of work with all these resrictions is what makes this more difficult than even my 4 credit class. 

she didnt care though and she waved me away. this conversation happened about 2 more times after this. im upset and frustrated because im doing my best to make sure i succeede and following the advice of ""talk to professors early! they'll work with you if you're dilligent!""  but she just. doesnt care. it doesn't help that when she DOES actually teach its super grating to listen to because she talks like she's teaching 5th graders. i still do my part and take notes for things i dont know but im at a loss. putting so much focus on this class is fucking with my time management for my other classes' homework because i have to spent such a disproportionate amount of time here. 

ALEKS is also horribly finniky. i typed an answer as 13x- 5x^2 +13 and got marked wrong because it wanted -5x^2 +13x +13. without stating anywhere that answers were ONLY accepted in standard notation. mind you tho, it accepts things like "" 45/9 "" and "" 2/8 "". 

Im currently doing my best but this class is making me despise math all over again, even though i know algebra can be really cool and im actually decent at it. how do i deal with this? should i keep talking to her? I've been thinking of just going to the department head, because im not the only person in this class struggling so much. I'm not withdrawing because i really dont have the money to essentially have wasted on the class and the stupid activation code for ALEKS. (my tuition is like 95% covered by federal aid, 5% im struggling to pay for out-of-pocket.)

edit: fixed the way my example shows up","['[deleted]', 'Ok, I’ll be honest...\n\nYour situation is not unique, lots of people work through college (hi), and learning new topics is difficult.

It's good for you. Do it for yourself, even if the college doesn't care.\n\nI suggest making a habit of doing math without a calculator. When you order food, add up the prices in your head.

Guilt over leaving,17,by3mox,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/by3mox/guilt_over_leaving/,8,"The title is pretty self explanatory. It’s my first time posting so excuse me if I break any prereq rules, I’m sorry. 

To add some context, I’ll be going to college this August, it’s a university about 6 hours away from home and it’s in state, although I’ll have to take a plane to another state to get their faster (ironic). With that being said, I chose that university specifically to leave home, and although that may be a stupid and idiotic reason to leave, I feel like it’s somewhat justified. 

From about freshman year to sophomore year, I had stellar grades and enough motivation to get somewhere in life and call it success. Looking into big name schools was a thing at the time but junior year and senior year was just a complete and utter mess. Between those two years, my relationship with my family diminished significantly, enough to the point where in school meetings with my parents and teachers became a norm. To keep it simple, I was never acknowledged or appreciated ever until I pushed myself out of my pit and into success. But, when things began to go downhill in junior year, they didn’t show that support. If anything, it felt like emotional blackmail to get good grades.

Not only did that mentally exhaust me, I felt useless and dumb honestly. The control my family has on me is literally the only reason why I’m leaving to a school that’s six hours away. I want a change to breathe, to explore anywhere else but home and to meet new people. Is it normal for me to feel guilty though? My brother guilt trips me for “leaving the family behind.” 

Specifically, he’s my twin* brother and therefore he’ll be attending college this year too. He rejected his admission to a notable university over the fact that, well, I honestly don’t care because it’s his choice and his alone. But, he blames that on me? I find it absurd that I have to deal with the fact that everyone is against my decision to move away? Being completely sheltered is a norm in the family so it’s not like I didn’t see this coming but damn?

Taking a long time to finish college?,4,catu4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/catu4w/taking_a_long_time_to_finish_college/,4,"Hi everyone!  This is my first time posting on here so correct me if this is in the wrong place. 

I'm feeling really unsure of college.  I was homeschooled my whole life and did well in school even though I never really enjoyed it that much.  College was never something that really interested me and I never knew ""what I wanted to be when I grew up"", so I decided to take a gap year and work. Well my gap year turned into 2.5yrs until I finally decided I wanted to get my degree so I wouldn't be stuck in retail forever. I decided to go to my local community college part time undecided, but I actually found a degree I that really interested me (Sound Recording Tech).  Our local community college is a great school and has a state of the art studio and great music program which is really nice for me. I've always wanted to work in the music industry and it felt really good to finally be working toward something. However I've always felt like I'm never going to ""make it"", so that self-doubt was always creeping underneath.  My three classes were going really good, I got really stressed after spring break, but after the semester was over I was still looking forward to next semester. I'm starting a summer class tomorrow, which I'm kinda dreading (3.5hrs of English, ew), but I want to get it out the way.  I'm starting to really stress about next semester and I don't know why.  I really love my degree, but I almost feel like it's not for me, and I just feel like I'm 17 and lost all over again.  I was going to do three classes again, but I started getting super stressed and anxious about the one class (the most important one) so I dropped it and will do it in the spring semester instead. I felt so much better after dropping it, so I decided I would replace it with an easier gen ed so at least I'm still doing a class. Now I'm getting super anxious again. I really feel like maybe I should just take two classes in the fall and work more, but then it's going to take me even longer to finish. I just have no idea what to do, I want to follow my gut and take my time but I also feel like I'll be at a disadvantage graduating older from CC (I'm 21 right now).  I don't plan on transferring to a four year school after this either. So my basic question is will it hurt me being older and graduating from community college so late if I take my time?  Btw, my parents have been very supportive through everything and they don't care as long as I'm working, so that's not an issue for me.","[""1) No one cares that you're graduating from a CC and that you're older\n\n2) If you're going into the music industry, then there's a slight chance that you may need a 4 year degree\n\n* I have close friends who are composers, filmmakers, songwriters, and music producers that work in LA and are doing very well for themselves and people who don't have degrees can't find assistantship work.\n* Also have another friend who hasn't been able to graduate and can't find ***good*** paid work because of lack of degree\n* But, honestly, if you're a musical badass Deity, then it won't really matter. But.\n\n3) Anxiety and depression are always going to attack you but you just have to figure out what you can handle, or can't handle, by doing it.

College Update 8-24-19,3,cv3h7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cv3h7p/college_update_82419/,2,"So today was my first full day of my sophomore year. Nothing too special. Went out for lunch with my dad and got a couple of things for my dorm. I rearranged some stuff so that everything fits nice. I think its coming together really well! I'm gonna have my own little space under my lofted bed, so that's always a plus. I'm kinda a personal space person, I've learned.
Anyways, this wasn't my first try coming up, since its August 24 and the team's move in day was the 21. I had a breakdown. Like, full on panic attack breakdown. My body was tense, shaking, clammy. I was crying and unable to function. Purely thought I was gonna die. My dad came home and  convinced my mom to drive me up and, so she did. The whole ride up was a mess between me  intermittedly crying and clenching my whole body in the fetal position and her calling my dad telling him I'm basically gonna have to drop out. So, we turned the car around, I skipped practice, and we went back home. Two days later, I drove myself up and have been doing alright since. I had to stop twice to regroup myself, but I pushed through and now I am living comfortably in my new room. 
No tears since I got here! I have had the typical morning anxiety, but I got a new app on my phone to help me meditate. Also, I dropped organic chemistry II and am going to look for at least one club that GENUINELY interests me. 
I want to feel good about myself here. I hope I can make this semester the year for me; the year for me to engage in self love. I'm going to take better care of my health, study something I'm passionate about, and do something that I can look forward to. Life is too short to try to do something you don't want to do; and college is especially shorter! I only have three years left, so I'm gonna try to make these more pleasant than last year. Maybe I'll never crave coming back here like the other students, but at least I won't sit around an count the hours until I can go home.
Wish me luck! ;)",['Good luck! Mind dropping the app name? :)'],8/25/19 7:23
Tentative Advice from Someone's Who's Been There,75,af8ti6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/af8ti6/tentative_advice_from_someones_whos_been_there/,4,"Salutations,

&#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a while since my college days and I see lots of posts here detailing both the good and bad about their college lives and the inquiries on how to make bad situations better.

&#x200B;

1. Your productivity velocity/Average Task completion for subject=Necessary time sacrifice.

Here's a very simple and easy way for most people to know how much time they need to devote to a single assignment. Measure your time to completion. Time how long it takes you to get it done. Try to comprehend how hard it was for you during the process and see if you can speed up your overall time through tricks and flow enhancing techniques. These can be striking out all the easiest questions so you save all the time to the hardest--not only for multiple choice but for those I.D. short answer questions that you can definitely get points on when you define the term for each and every one of them instead of stalling on trying to come up for an example for a single one. Knowing your working throughput makes you able to accurately set up timeboxes and deadlines to help you measure your overall time and set up cushions.

&#x200B;

Also to help you know when to stop studying.

&#x200B;

Yes, you heard me right, stop studying.

&#x200B;

I came from a high-level semi-international level Chinese school that did nothing but death-march kids through college-level material in 7-8 courses for years so the ones that made it out of high school got good by committing to two choices. We got good at suffering more than anyone else, riding at exams with eldritch curses vomited forth from our lips driven by fears ancestral disappointment and utter destruction or, and this is less common, we got really good at the metathinking and mechanics of doing the work. The cost of learning advanced trig is 4 days of hard brutal cramming. The cost of memorizing all the types of questions for the predictable exam is 4 hours.

&#x200B;

Unless you plan to be a master, I suggest you don't obliterate your own minds limited willpower. And considering that most people don't come from ridiculous studying death marches since they could write, you don't have the drilled and practiced ability to suffer eternally while not losing any productivity. This is not a slight against you nor a benefit to us. It's just how you were molded by your environment and practice. There are benefits and losses to both. I explain the damage that death marching does soon enough.

&#x200B;

If there is one idea that did miracles for me in college for my studies, its the concept of minimal time and effort spent to get an A-.

&#x200B;

Spend much more than what is required on average, that bleeds over to other subjects, your hobbies, your clubs, and your career development time.

&#x200B;

That's not a good thing. That's time waste. Time waste will gut you and bleed you good and fast when the assignments come avalanching down at the end of the semester.

&#x200B;

Don't get buried or you spend the rest of your time spraying crap back to your professors to crawl your way out.

&#x200B;

This leads to my next point.

&#x200B;

2. You don't have free time, you have expendable time.

&#x200B;

Timebox your hours by the week, and absolutely by the day. If you enjoy having a spot of fun go for it. It's important to lubricate your brain and oil your fortitude with rejuvenating activities. Know that you have to include some time for yourself.

&#x200B;

Trust me, you'll need it.

Often, I advise people to plan around their necessary time sacrifice for academia because that's a constant but day to day, that's up to you. If you don't have class on Monday and you want to go hog-wild running around buck-naked with an airhorn clenched between your cheeks, go for it. Just know that time will be coming out of your weekly allotted time. And potentially a restraining order.

&#x200B;

Students often joke about the social life, studying, sleeping triangle. You can choose two. Or if you're an engineer, just one. This is true for the average student perhaps, but you are not aiming to be the average student. I hope. Try to keep an average of your sleeping time. If you feel most rested from 11-6, go for that and do that consistently. If you party wild and hard, I recommend building a routine of power naps that will keep you charged across your days. Keep your tanks fueled or prepare to stall and break.

&#x200B;

Factor this into your timebox as well.

&#x200B;

Hobbies, clubs, careers, and relationships are major concerns that must be addressed as well.

&#x200B;

My concept for this part: pick your priorities in the timebox but don't forsake all the others entirely.

&#x200B;

Specialize, but remain cross-functional. This will save you when it comes time to build a life as an adult.

&#x200B;

3. Prepare for the future and accept the chaos.

&#x200B;

""Your future is bright.""

&#x200B;

This platitude is blasted at you more times than your roommate towards your shower curtains when they think you're not watching--side note, when living together set clear boundaries but always be prepared to bleach everything and have an out.

&#x200B;

It sounds nice.

&#x200B;

Feels good.

&#x200B;

Is entirely bullshit.

&#x200B;

You have no idea how your life is going to go. At all.

&#x200B;

To counter this quote with a quote from Unforgiven, ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it.""

&#x200B;

You don't get what you deserve. You don't get what you work for sometimes. Keep your mind on the infinite game rather than the limited one. Know what is true to you and what you want to be working for. And if you don't, accept the discomfort knowing that you are in the majority and aren't behind the curve.

&#x200B;

In fact, there is no curve.

&#x200B;

So many of my classmates from high school, boys and girls who were monsters of art and science, flunked out of college. The material was easy to them. They could death march forever. But there were not prepared for the freedom. And they lacked the self-discipline.

&#x200B;

Frankly, too many of us came to college to early, I would argue. Just because you can study forever doesn't mean you will. The allegory of the cave makes sense here with the cave being constant studying and the light outside being self-management and independence. In high school, what is pitched is that you have no choice. People will ride you like a rented mule in a field of snakes. Your parents, your teachers, your student leaders. They own you, on some level.

&#x200B;

Then you get to college and no one truly cares.

&#x200B;

Then you learn that life isn't about managing stress or pressure if you're used to that. It's about managing the apathy.

&#x200B;

This destroys kids who, by all other metrics, should be ready.

&#x200B;

On top of this, just because you're good at death marching and doing academics doesn't mean you're ready for life. A few classmates that graduated along with me went into rehab.

&#x200B;

Drugs. Alcohol. Depression. Loneliness. This is common. You think you can suffer forever. Until you can't.

They were high achievers but they broke down and gave up right after the finish line because in their minds, it was all for nothing.

&#x200B;

They went to school because mom and dad told them to. Or just because it was expected of them. Or they did majors they didn't care about.

&#x200B;

You need to find your own way. Find your own reason. Spend time trying to understand that. The world has very little meaning to it. Existence, if you aren't religious or spiritual, doesn't mean anything beyond 42. That's an absolute standpoint. You're looking at the relative.

&#x200B;

Be pragmatic with your mind and soul. Let's not bullshit ourselves here, if you hate pre-med or accounting but think that the job is going to make you happy, you got another thing coming. The money might make you happy but let me tell you, after a certain threshold when it gets to be enough, you stop working for the money and instead for the task.

&#x200B;

Coincidentally, this is also how wage-slaving works. It's low engagement low pay work sold to you as experience or with the potential to make you rich. If you have to do these jobs, do them briefly but just leave. Loyalty is a desiccated corpse these days for a good majority of the companies that I have trained within. You are not obliged to suffer. Apologies for the tangent but it is necessary.

&#x200B;

Back to college, keep in mind the fun of these years is about the journey. Education is about more than books. Understand yourself. Know your limitations. Know your flaws. Know your strengths. Try to know them as objectively as possible.

&#x200B;

Some hard truths might come at you, like the foundations of self-loathing for example. I learned during college that though I hated myself at times for the wrong reasons, I deserved that hate by all accounts because I didn't address the core issue. It's like beating yourself without improving so you can have more room to beat yourself later. Of course you're going to hate yourself its a self-perpetuating cycle.

&#x200B;

Engage your flaws on your terms. Engage the darkest moments on your terms. Don't think about yourself when you're in a depressed mood. Don't make choices when you're down. Be on the offense. Especially with yourself. Build on yourself. Break down yourself. Rebuild yourself.

&#x200B;

But do it while you have control.

&#x200B;

No one ever won a fight by taking a punch.

&#x200B;

If you need help, find it with professionals but also with friends and family if you can. The wholeness of support can drill into our very pattern driven minds that we can get better if by osmosis alone.

&#x200B;

4. Don't be afraid to walk away.

&#x200B;

I finished college with a GPA of 3.8. I was a writer for several clubs, the vice-president for one, a president for another, a division-three athlete, while working part-time. I finished two majors in four years.

&#x200B;

You might have bad grades. You might be thinking of dropping out. You might have already dropped out.

&#x200B;

I am not worth more than you. I mean this objectively and subjectively. My success does not correlate to your failure. The truth is, with the vastness of experiences and our lives, I don't know what you went through to get here. You probably don't know me. Hell, I could have been lying this entire time and just been a sapient walrus learning human behavior online in hopes of preparing for the eventual uprising led by our lord and sovereign Jamie Hyneman. However, comparing your darkest moments and your missteps to my victories and glories is a lot like saying I won while you tripped briefly on a set of stairs. A set of stairs that extends forever.

&#x200B;

Know this, you are not done unless you say you are. This isn't some motivational speech bullshit. It's not me trying pump you up. It just the truth. The wheel turns on. The show goes on. The highlight reel ends.

&#x200B;

I just told you all about how well I was doing in school. What I didn't tell you was following the end of college, I felt like doing nothing because I had no goals for myself for the future because I didn't care much for me and so I just sat in a dead-end job for half a year because.

&#x200B;

I thought I was made for bigger things but that's not what always happens. Sometimes things just go sideways. But they keep going.

&#x200B;

The point is, if you truly, definitely don't want to stay in college, that's okay too.

&#x200B;

You have to live for yourself eventually. Make your own choices. Being an adult is about taking responsibility for your own life. Nothing more. The choice is up to you.

&#x200B;

If the disappointment of others makes you deny your own will, know that the price of that is going to be paid by you. They will not suffer being you in misery. They will, however, complain regarding why you are miserable, as I have observed with multiple peers and their friends who are parochial if I am to describe them gently.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'd like to end this tentative smattering of advice with a shameless plug for a book series, The Stormlight Archive. Yes, it's fantasy. Yes, it feels like an anime sometimes. But even if you don't like those things, I implore you to read a single chapter in the third book, Oathbringer, titled, the Girl Who Looked Up. It helped a few people I know out of some dark places. Maybe it might do some good to you.

&#x200B;

Anyway, happy semesters and good luck.

&#x200B;

Remember, focus on the journey before the destination.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","['Wow this is amazing ', ""Really great advice. And also, I think your first point is related to the 80/20 rule: 20% of the effort accounts for 80% of the result.

How to relax after being burnt out and move forward?,1,6b7c44,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6b7c44/how_to_relax_after_being_burnt_out_and_move/,5,"It’s affecting me mentally and emotionally. I’m having issues conversing with family or being around other people.

Background:

I was a CS major before switching to Computer Informatics in my SENIOR year. Now I have two years left till graduation in a major I have zero knowledge of and don’t know what the degree leads to since it was the closest degree of my interest and credits transferring wise.
 
Some people are telling me to take it slow and some are saying to push through because a degree will help you get a job and it might get better from there.

Right Now:

I’m currently in summer break applying to some internships (which I’m not stressed if I’m not accepted). I’m also trying to work on coding and other computer related subjects in the field. My main issue is I can’t even look at code anymore: it stresses, tires, and frustrates me to no extent nowadays. Every time I’m trying to learn something new, I get frustrated and my head gets clouded with anger. I can’t concentrate, I can’t focus. I’m completely burnt out and un-disciplined. I want to work, learn, and succeed but I feel too fatigued (maybe b/c I want results fast). 

My GPA has fallen a lot but its not completely ruined. Currently at 2.95. I try going to the gym or other distractions but I’m constantly thinking about work, college, and my future.

** After I tried to work on a simple Bootstrap site with a tutorial and could not get it done, I slept the last 18 / 24 hours in. 

TL;DR: I really need help trying to clear my head. Thinking about going to a counselor to talk out my problems. Any previous advice to de-stress would be awesome.

This is basically a vent but I would love help.","['Yup, sounds like burnout to me. Try to schedule dedicated time to doing things that you love and that energize you. This can be as simple as hanging out with your best friend, pursuing a hobby unrelated to coding, exercising, reading a book you\'ve been meaning to read, walking in the woods, exploring a nearby town by yourself, etc. \n\nProtect this self-care time! Don\'t let work or obligations get in the way. That way you are refreshed every few days and can recover from your burnout. Think about burnout as your gas tank being on ""empty"". You can ram the gas pedal all you want, but you\'re not going anywhere. You need to ""fill"" your gas tank with energizing and meaningful experiences to keep you going through hard times. Self-care is not a luxury, it\'s a necessity. ', ""1. Breathe - Do this for a few minutes while not doing anything else\n2. Your major may be leading you to a career in IT and while it can involve code, there are also alternative careers such as Help Desk, System Administration, Network Administration to name a few. \n3. Take everyone's advice, write it down and put it somewhere that is not your head. Honestly, taking advice is more stressful than making the decision yourself. I will tell you that I was in a similar spot, I was in a rut and was considering taking a break/dropping out cause I did not know what the hell I was doing. It took a helluva momentum swing in my favor to respark my interest in finishing. \n4. Might get crap for this.......IT is a field where its degree optional*\n* = You can get a great career and make respectable money (even 6 figures) but you won't be able to have a fair shot at every company. Some will stop you due to lack of a degree, some will still give you a chance. \n\n5. GPA, unless you are on scholarship, probation, or applying to grad school is at a good state right now. The line C's get degrees still holds true. \n\nYou have two years left until you graduate. Try and set up some meetings with an adviser, career services and/or a professor or two to see what you can do with your major. They may be able to shed some light and give you some guidance. \nAlso see if your school's IT department takes on students. It grants experience and allows to see how IT operates. If you can't go that route, I recommend a job in retail as backup.

Is my dad right that I'm only doing the bare minimum?,1,bgxz83,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bgxz83/is_my_dad_right_that_im_only_doing_the_bare/,6,"I've been going to community college since 2016, and it hasn't gone great. I've been put on academic probation multiple times and struggled every year to come up with the money to cover what financial aid won't because I can't go full time. I can't take more than 3 classes at a time, but it's really more like 2 because taking 3 makes my performance in one of them suffer every single time. A lifelong learning disability and long-time depression have made things kind of hellish.

I was initially going to transfer to a university or possibly art school, but if just this is so difficult, I don't think I'm cut out for it, and if getting money is tough now, it's going to be even harder then. So after a lot of thought, I abandoned my major and transfer program in favor of an Associate's of General Studies. I should graduate at some point next year, and hopefully get a small job downtown.

I feel a bit less stressed now, but my dad seems to think I've basically given up, asking me if I'm only going to school to ""warm a seat"". Like he thinks that for all I'm invested in my schooling right now, I might as well not be going at all. It's true that I don't do any extracurriculars, don't go out with any friends, and don't really care about taking classes that are interesting or challenging (I'm just trying to get everything that's mandatory done, preferably as easy as possible), but even the bare minimum is still really tough, to me.

I think that's kind of easy for him to say, given he went to a state university where he had the luxury of being able to experiment with what he wanted to learn and how. I don't, and I've abandoned my career plans so I don't see the point of getting a more specialized degree if I wouldn't know what to do with it. So I'd rather play it 100% safe and get out of college as fast as I possibly can, and get a local 9-5 job for the foreseeable future.

"I dropped out of college with a terrible GPA, with my transcript haunting my transfer prospects, and I just got rejected from the school I had hoped would help me turn things around. Is there anything I can do?",31,8e90oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8e90oi/i_dropped_out_of_college_with_a_terrible_gpa_with/,29,"TL;DR After dropping out of university, I applied for the only local school in my area that I felt had a program both suited to my career aspirations and was well within my level (at least by my high school transcript's standards), but was rejected today. I am completely unsure of how to proceed from here.

Here is my situation (everything up to the bulleted list can be skipped if you don't care):

5 years ago, I was accepted to a prestigious out-of-state university after high school. Following a fairly typical pattern of laziness, procrastination, stress, depression, and anxiety, I had put myself into a corner by the end of my 3rd year. My grades were awful and I was put on academic probation, but I was afraid to completely change my major because it was still ultimately what I was interested in. Additionally, there were not that many other majors offered at my school that would lead to career prospects I would be interested in pursuing. Wasting time, credits, and money was also a big concern, but in retrospect that should have been the least of my worries.

By the time I was halfway through what should have been my 4th year, the academic probation had become suspension, and I had been halfheartedly attempting to follow a readmission program, being unwilling to accept that I needed to take time off and thus alienate myself from my peers. Ironically, I had wasted far more resources than I already had by refusing to give in and attempting to pivot to different but similar majors, as well as taking then dropping classes I needed to do well in to be considered for readmission. The situation had reached critical mass, and I realized that there was no chance that I would be able to salvage the situation the way I was at the time. I finally decided that no amount of counseling sessions or self-motivation tactics would be enough for me to turn things around all at once, and that I should cut my losses, drop out, and move back home to give myself time to reevaluate myself and my situation.

At home, I spent several months almost entirely lazing about and attempting to recover from the mental trauma accompanying the decision to drop out and all that followed. I wasn't ready to apply to schools for the following spring semester at the time, so I didn't even bother. Eventually I decided to collect myself a little bit and consider my options for the fall application deadlines. The thought process went roughly as follows:

- Moving back to try for readmission at my school again is a last resort option. Though I do want to stay on the same major path, doing so at that school would be near impossible, as I would be unable to retake classes that I passed, despite my working knowledge of those classes being shaky at best, nonexistent at worst. The insurmountable gap created by 3 years worth of compounding ignorance had been one of the primary reasons I gave up in the first place, after all.
- I could try reapplying for a completely different, ""easier"" major at my school, but that would be a massive waste of resources, including having to move cross-country again, for questionable return, especially if it was a major I did not have any interest in. And that's assuming that I am confident that I could even excel in that ""easy"" major in the first place.
- The best bet would probably be to go to a local or semi-local school, such a state school, that offers a program in the major I am interested in, and is feasible to get accepted into.
- Unfortunately, it seems that all schools would require me to apply as a transfer applicant, and despite having a promising high school application, my college transcript does me no favors.

With all this in mind, I found one state school within driving distance of my home that had a promising program perfectly suited to what I was looking for. This was the only school that was conveniently located, had a suitable program, and was of a level where I believe I would have had no trouble being admitted out of high school, but was still fairly well regarded. After talking to my family, I decided that I would solely apply to this school, as no other school I could find fit all of those needs. If I got rejected here, there were certainly no better or comparable options that I could count on. I emailed the admissions office with various questions and explanations of my situation, and received several informative replies, as well as one rather curt response saying that if my GPA was that bad, I should try to get my GPA back up at a community college before applying.

I didn't, and still don't, consider this a viable option, as the sheer amount of failed classes on my transcript would mean that I would have long since graduated from the community college before getting my grades to an acceptable level. The response worried me, and I understood that there were no guarantees, but I couldn't think of any better options, so I put my application together, replete with a suggested letter of appeal explaining my situation and a letter from the counselor I had to see at my previous school as part of the readmission process, and sent it in.

That was several months ago, and I waited until today, when I received notice of my rejection. I had really hoped for this not to be the case, but it was not completely surprising either. The problem is that I now have no idea how to proceed, as that was by far and away the best option I could think of. I've looked up many posts and guidelines for applying to college as a drop out, but none of them addressed the issue of a tragic irreparable GPA that can't be fixed with a stint at community college. Apart from attempting to return to my old school, with the issues mentioned above, the only other thing I can think of is going to a local community college with the intent of graduating there. It's not as though I have anything against community college (in fact the local one is quite nice), but it is so frustrating to have my college transcript work against my high school achievements to the point that it feels like my application prospects are worse than if I had never gone to high school at all. I can't even apply with just my high school transcript as a new applicant and start over, as all the schools I checked consider me to be a transfer applicant only. Is there really nothing else I can do?","[""I would suggest trying a community college and inquiring about an academic renewal. I'm sure they can work something out."", 'Community college all the way. So what if your timeline is a bit messed up.....community college will help you get your desired outcome.

Make sure you look into articulation agreements so your credits transfer over without issue. They will see your CC GPA and hopefully it will be high and you should get in without issue.\n\nUnfortunately you will be required to submit your previous transcript. Write a note explaining basically how you were not ready for college and that going back to community college allowed you to reach your academic potential.

I would definitely commit to attending a community college to get used to the rigor of school again and looking into any transfer agreements.\n\nAlso, if you do well at a CC, at least in my state, you can qualify for a scholarship only for transfer students to a state college. That’s something to think about and work toward.\n\nGood luck, and hang in there.

How to stop basing my self-worth on grades?,1,bw7c9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bw7c9a/how_to_stop_basing_my_selfworth_on_grades/,3,"Hey! I'm a high school student who's taking some college courses, and having some extreme issues about my grades. I'm a mostly straight-A student, with grades of all 95% or higher in my classes, but I have an extremely skewed perception of my own self-worth. Essentially, I'm every stressed out high school student trying to prepare for college. I've got finals coming up in about 2 days, and I'm especially anxious about my chemistry final and my french final. To be honest, I'm worried that this kind of mentality is going to absolutely destroy me in college and next year, when I take even more AP classes. I have breakdowns over losing 0.38% in my grades, and I anxiously calculate my grades down to the decimal to see what I need to get on the finals.

&#x200B;

I'm specifically worried about chemistry and french, since I'd be devastated if I ended up getting below a 96% on either of those. I'm someone who's very passionate about science and love it a lot, and I tend to console myself by thinking that well, if nothing else, I'm at least good at the sciences. I'll need over a 95% on this final to keep my over 100%, and I'm worried that if I don't make that goal, I'll have a complete breakdown.

&#x200B;

It's partially because I care so much what other teachers and students think of me, I think, that this issue affects me so much--I've always wanted to be seen as ""smart"" and I've always had a bit of a complex related to how I'm good at things, but never excelled in anything and never got awards. I'm a student who gets consistent 4.0 GPAs but I don't stand out among them, y'know? And that's a huge part of why my grades are so important. I'm just worried that this is going to only exacerbate my depression and grade-related anxiety once I hit college and school becomes much, much harder.

I know this isn't healthy for me and that it's my fault I think like this, and I'd appreciate any help with trying to break out of this mentality!

Merit Scholarship Appeal,2,cf73ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cf73ox/merit_scholarship_appeal/,1,"For background info: I did not meet the requirements to maintain my scholarship in semester 2 2018. We found out my grandfather has cancer at this time and he passed away shortly after. My family obviously became my priority but I decided to go through with the examinations anyways. I wasn't comfortable using his death as an excuse or even asking for the death certificate. He lived in our home country so this process may take longer. I was placed on breached status for semester 1 2019, where I have another chance to bring my grades up. My clinical placements also begun this semester which took priority over my uni work (placement is pass/fail and not counted towards our overall grade). My mental health took a dive but I still didn't seek help and thought I'd push through. It wasn't till my second placement (still semester 1) where I realised I'm fucked if my mental health keeps messing me up in the workforce, especially since the job requires me to  be 'on' all the time. So I did seek help with a GP at the end of semester and was put on antidepressants. Regardless of what the outcome is of this appeal, I'm still relieved I finally got the help I needed and am more motivated to do well. I used to be filled with self doubt but passing my placements definitely helped with my confidence.

I don't know if I should disclose the information regarding my grandfather's death (I'm not sure if I'm still comfortable with that), or I should just include information from this year, which is how my mental health fucked me over.

**School**

Take notes and study. Make friends with the smart people in the class. Don’t worry about missing out on “fun” that can be a good thing. Study groups and TAs exist- do not waste your/your parents/scholarship money!! Actually go to class and study.

**Partying.**

Avoid Alcohol. Avoid Marijuana. Avoid Marijuana. Did I say avoid Marijuana? Avoid drugs of all kinds actually, as well as the people doing them. Youll do best to focus on school and if you befriend those types it has an osmosis like effect. I am a college “failure” and I dropped out of school three times because of this. You ought to be filling your head with new information, ideas on how to help others, figuring your life out. Weed can destroy your college career.

A lot of people at this age(18-19) are naive and think some drinking and some weed smoking is a part of college life. These people rarely go far in life. Avoid them. I was one of these people. I left school and spent time in rehabs because years later when weed started making me paranoid and alcohol didnt give me the feelings I wanted, I did a lot of pills and opiates. At age 23 I am not in a successful place and I can trace it to me looking for chemical fun instead of becoming disciplined at age 18. It is a tragedy. A close childhood friend of mine died of a heroin overdose last week. Please do not alter your consciousness. Keep in mind in College I was the deadhead who took LSD a lot and smoked weed every day and did a lot of adderall. I regret ever starting because all of it led to me having opiate addictions and psychological problems later in life. Better to be a square than to be a burnout like me or dead like my old friend is.

**Sex.**

You are better off not getting too caught up in this. Be a gentleman and be good to female friends but ladies and gentlemen, you don’t want syphilis or some other venereal disease and you don’t want to have awkward run ins with one off sexual partners you have classes with. It is a distraction. It’s your choice and all, but especially to any young women reading this- I bet if you save it until you are married or in a long term relationship that is serious with a really good person, it has more value and less problems. In general treat this as another drug that can lead to all kinds of emotions, my personal advice is to be a prudish dork and focus on school, I was not. Who knows what VD I have. Gross.

**Watch out who you associate with**

Be careful to be friends with people thinking long term. This will be what seperates you from people who are messing around and not getting good grades. 

Like I said, utilize tutors, go to study groups, take things seriously. It is cushy in college but in the real world things can be gnarly(from my experience living without a degree, i failed everything and my first semester was great but I was too focused on drugs and esoteric bs and got in really bad places)

**Your safety zone should be:**

1.Go to every class
2. Take notes
3. Study those notes
4. Know your professors.


Again,


(my advice from experience)Avoid:
Drugs(including alcohol- seriously that’s the most dangerous drug)
Risky sex
People who are not thinking long term

In short, I basically use Reddit as my social media. It provides me with access to whatever interests me through subreddits. I don't have to worry about making a profile, or updating my life, or acting like I care about other people's lives.

But I understand I'm in probably the very very small minority of people who don't use it. If I were to use one, I'd probably go with Twitter as in my eyes that's the closest thing to Reddit. But it just feels like so much work to me - having to use it to socialize with people I meet. 

Because I know if I do want to make friends they'll probably ask me ""so what's ur IG, snap, etc?"" and I'll be like ""oh I don't use any if that"" and I'll just feel like such an outsider. They'll probably look at me as some weirdo.

It sucks to say but fuck, I just want to fit in. At the same time I hate the thought of forcing myself to use social media because it's just not me. It especially feels really self absorbed to me posting about my life, on top of that it's really not that interesting lol...

An important lesson for all incoming freshmen on bathrooms,0,8zhbz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8zhbz6/an_important_lesson_for_all_incoming_freshmen_on/,10,"To all of you coming to college in the fall with the intention of living here, I’m sure you’re all excited. You get freedom, and a chance at adulthood. 

This summer, I’ve had the chance to have a trial college run in my new college based upon this state run program, courtesy of New Jersey. So far, I’ve learned how to make my bed, how to make a paper, and how to poop.

When you’re at home, you tend to poop freely. At school you tend to stop, because it’s disgusting and people tend to be dirty pigs. From experience, I never went in a public bathroom at school. I just used the English Department’s bathroom, because I was really close with them and the VP didn’t care if a student asked. But most of the time, I would only go in the morning, when I first woke up, and then once I got home at 5. But that was still bad. You might live at college from August to Thanksgiving. Or you might stay during the week and go home on the weekends on laundry. Regardless, that’s five days. You should get used to it. 

My first week at college was hard, and pun intended. But I found ways around it.

There’s some things you should do:

1. Poop alone. Sometimes you won’t feel as self conscious if you have an audience. You should try to go during times when not a lot of people have breaks, like at night when everybody is partying or during class times. Say everybody on your phone has an 8 AM class, go then. Put on music or a tv show if you have to, so you forget you’re not in a communal bathroom. Don’t worry. They get cleaned on the reg, and everybody understands to clean up after them self. Only, the ones in the classrooms might not, especially if you take summer courses where 100 kids out of a 2,000 school are taking classes. My school rented out space to a day camp with the YMCA, like the pool and a science lab, so the bathrooms in one building did look like toddlers had been through it. Don’t worry though, as they aren’t usually like that. There will be that occasional person who doesn’t flush, but it’s really far between.

2. Drink a lot of soda/Gatorade/energy drinks. I’m not joking. That’s how I got me to poop. Took me days to do. At the designated mealtimes, I would drink regular Pepsi (were a Pepsi school sorry) and then at night during study hall, run to poop. Just be warned, if you drink too much, it turns your poop moss green and stinky. Try a cup or two, not the entire bottle day after day. Also, soda at college is expensive. A bottle in the vending machine, for me, was two dollars, while it was free in the mess hall (and you get unlimited drinks) and one dollar at the Rite Aid by my house. Also, for girls, be warned that those girly things are expensive. It was two dollars for a regular tampon. Bring your own. Campus might seem like a bubble, especially in rural or suburban areas, but they have ways around it.

3. Poop when you have to. From experience, I can tell you that if you let it accumulate and just wait until class ends, you’ll end up taking fifteen minutes, sitting on the toilet, sweating and in pain. The reason? I always thought I would miss something so I would stay in class and wait until I got back to my dorm. While I still tend to do it, I try my hardest to stop.

4. Poop after you eat. While it might seem like you’re a bulimic, it works. At home, I would always poop after I had a big meal, as it emptied me out and made more room. College isn’t like high school: if you have to use the bathroom, just leave. Most professors don’t care if you’re out for 15 minutes, as it might be a hike (for me it was) or you might be constipated or whatnot. Just don’t miss the entire lesson. If you just had lunch and now have to take English 101, wait for the teacher to give directions and then go. Just, don’t miss the whole lesson, or don’t poop if it’s a difficult class, like a remedial math or a chemistry course for an English major. You could end up missing something important. I always try to go after I finish my work, like after a test.

5. Try to eat poop foods. In addition to soda, there’s other things you can try: oatmeal, beans, broccoli, nuts, berries, tacos, apples, popcorn. It might depend on your cafeteria though. My school is small, so we only have one, and it’s usually only a few foods. However, we are allowed to order out. Know that college towns tend to have a lot of foods, like Chipotle, Taco Bell, etc. many of which are rich in poop foods. 

6. Force yourself to poop. If all else fails, sit on the toilet and poop. I would only advise against it if you are in class, or if there’s a line in the bathroom. You’ll either miss work or you’ll make others miss it. 

Best of luck!","['[deleted]', 'So have your movements make an appointment. Good advice.', 'Personally I apply for admission whrn requesting to use the pooper', ""This is hilarious lol, but I don't want to underestimate the troubles pooping can bring. I certainly would not want to jinx it. "", 'Just out of curiosity, why did you never go to the bathroom at school before? I could never imagine waiting until I got home to go to the bathroom. This was perplexing to read because it has never been a problem for me']",7/17/18 6:32
(Seeking Advice) Dropped out of college at 19. I'm 22 now and really regret it. Is it even feasible to go back given my situation? Trying to figure out what my options are.,5,8btex1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8btex1/seeking_advice_dropped_out_of_college_at_19_im_22/,8,"So long story short, when I was 19 I made the horrible decision of quitting community college to move 2 hours away from my hometown with my at the time girlfriend who was just starting college. Even reading over what I've just written makes me cringe...

But anyway, fast forward a few years later: I'm 22 and living on my own, working full-time, and making a little under $15/hr. in the aforementioned city I moved to a couple of years ago. I like it here and will be living here at the very least for another year seeing as I am bound to my apartment lease.

Thing is, I realize just how stupid of a decision it was to abandon my education. Don't get me wrong, it's been a good experience living away from home and having to support myself. Eye-opening even. I enjoy my independence, but I definitely want to challenge myself and get an education rather than be bound to my retail job indefinitely. Of course it's partially about money, but I genuinely want to learn and explore academics. Can't stop kicking myself for abandoning and not to mention neglecting that outlet in my life. Truly a lost opportunity. 

What's tough about the whole situation is that being a student as I once was feels so distant to me. I mean yeah of course, cause it's been a few years. But it's a weird feeling. Almost as if I never lived it. And of course most everyone my age that I meet is finishing college. Then again I do live in the heart of a bustling college town. It takes a toll on my self-esteem and I feel less equipped socially and mentally. I definitely feel like it is a crutch now that I'm almost 23. And not to compare myself to everyone else; the sheer fact that I've missed out on and deprived myself of furthering my education is something I view as a personal shortcoming. But I want to forget the past and my horrible decision and go back to school once and for all. I want a quality education. It's just when I was 18/19 I didn't care at all. My parents practically had to drag me to the local community college for a tour, and getting me to apply to college was likely akin to pulling teeth for them. I was such an idiot...

I don't wanna sound like that guy, but honestly I've changed considerably and I feel ready to take this step. But I also feel so lost in trying to figure out what my options are. Like I said, I'm living on my own and working full time, so life is already pretty busy for me. I should mention that I would prefer to try and go for a bachelor's rather than do a 2-year program at a tech school.

I mean, do I move back home with my parents and go to school while perhaps working part-time somewhere instead? It's a tough choice because I do really enjoy the city I currently live in, and I have to be here for another 12 months. Do I try and go to school here? I'm doubtful and feel like applying anywhere would be futile. I mean my GPA in college was not good, and on top of that I am of course a drop out. Not looking for sympathy, these are merely two things causing me to doubt the viability of even going back.

Really didn't intend to ramble on, and apologies for any grammatical errors or confusion. Kinda just pounding away on the keyboard as quickly as I can since I'm at work. But any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Dropped out of college when I was 19. Now I'm 22, living on my own in a bigger city, and working full time. But I want to go back to college. Just not sure how to go about doing so, and furthermore am unsure whether it's even a feasible option at this point given my situation.","[""My advice would be to start taking your GEs at a community college. Try taking some interesting classes if you're not sure what you want to major in yet.

If there's another CC in the city you're in now you should be able to easily register for classes there.  Depending on where you transfer to for your Bachelors you might be able to knock out some gen ed requirements for pretty cheap/maybe free and then transfer.  If you do well at the CC you could get a scholarship to a 4 year school.\n\nEither way, you can definitely make this happen.  I did, more or less, the same thing.  Dropped out of a CC at 18 - not even for a girl, just because I was into making bad decisions.  Got my life together and started over at a CC in another state at 23.  I did well, got an associates degree with highest honors, got a full scholarship to a well known private university to complete my BA."", ""What do you want to do as a career?\n\nIf you don't know, then hold off on college until you do know."", ""I didn't start college until I was 21.. then I dropped out and didn't return until I was 24.

16 ways how top students study by Loy Machedo,16,7n386j,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7n386j/16_ways_how_top_students_study_by_loy_machedo/,7,"I have had the honor and privilege of mentoring students who applied for a few Top Ivy League Colleges. And I even have 2 clients who are currently at Harvard. So given my interaction with them here are some of the pointers I feel will help you become a Top Student yourself.

**1. Very Clear Cut Goal**  
Almost every Top Notch performer I have worked with has a very clear cut goal stated IN WRITING. They have this goal pasted on top of their study table, in the toilet, on a notice board in the house, and some of them even have a piece of paper in their pocket. That is the kind of obsession they have with their goal.   
  
- It is very clear. It is very specific. They have the date, the time, the number - whatever possible to make the goal as clear, as specific, as measurable and as powerful as possible. For instance - I have met a peak performer who stated “I want to run fast” rather I have met people who achieved their goal as “At the Dubai Half Marathon on 3rd December 2017, I will run 21kms in 1 hour 59 minutes”.   
  
- And once they create and craft their goal - they work backwards to where they are currently at the moment.   
  
- Top notch students have a long term strategy where they are, where they wish to go and they even know why they want to get there.

**2. Long Term Plan**
I have yet to meet a student who just planned out his future for one year. But I have met many Top notch performers who have clearly stated a long term strategy. For instance students have a clear cut goal of what their future is going to be like I will take up science stream with specialization in 123, from there I will pursue a career as a doctor who will specialize in XYZ, from the University of ABC. And after that…..”  
  
It is never a 6 months or 1 year goal. Never. It is always a career plan that is carefully and intelligently crafted for a lifetime.

**3. Backup Plans**
There is a certain thrill that comes from having an outlandish goal and achieving it. And don’t we all love to have a underdog success story! However, smart & practical people know that there is always a possibility that they may fail. So even though the student (or competitor) goes Kamakazi with a “Do or Die” attitude in heart, there is always a smart strategy being kept alive in their mind - that is in case failure comes knocking on their door. So that is where not just Plan (A) is in effect, there is always a Plan (B) kept secretly intact. And if Plan (B) doesn’t work, there is a Plan (C).

**4. 100% Family Support**  
If there is one criteria I feel is exceptionally important - it would be this one. You cannot - just cannot succeed in your goal to become a Top Student if you have an environment that doesn’t support your goal.   
  
Imagine trying to study in a noisy house where everyone is watching TV or having fun with their friends. Almost every Top Student I worked with - the Mother, the Father and the entire family was behind the youngster. You need this kind of support every single day - day-in and day-out.   
  
I have literally known parents who wake up with the young child in the morning (at 2am) prepare his/her breakfast and then go to sleep. At 5am drive the child to extra classes. After classes, the child is taken to school. En the breakfast is given. Once school is done with - again the child is picked up and brought home. Once at home - lunch, a 1 hour nap - and back to studies. And after that a break - rest and then back to studies with another tutor. Finally dinner and sleep. Throughout the entire schedule - the parent - both the Father and Mother ensure that the child is being supported towards this one goal.

 **5. Consistency **
You can not and I mean CANNOT achieve Top Notch Status if you are not consistent. It is not about taking the book for one day - reading it for 18 hours and thats it. Day after day after day the student takes up his book to study, learn, research and focus completely on his goal - to become Number 1. And there are some whom I have known to be consistent towards their goal for 12 years - which calls for incredible consistency.

**6. Total Immersion & Obsession**
If you want the 1st step and only step among everything else towards being a Top Notch Student - it would be this one ingredient. The level of Immersion (being involved and into something) and the amount of Obsession (Crazy Focus) with regards to their goal in life is beyond human. 

I remember meeting this young girl (South Indian) at my residence. Her parents had brought her to me with regards to preparing her for a Presentation. No matter what I asked her - even casually, there was only one answer, one priority, one focus - she wanted to be Number 1 in her college with the highest marks. 

When I asked her what her hobbies were, when I asked her what she did in her spare time and even when I asked her what she liked - there was only one answer - To succeed in her goal of being the Number 1 student. Even though I felt it was a bit extreme - but I was blown away with the intensity and her focus. And mind you - by speaking to her for a few minutes - I knew 100% she would achieve her goal no matter what. 

So if you want to be a Top Notch student - this element is paramount.

**7. Smart Choices of Friends**
Here is a Pop Quiz for you - 
Choose one. 

- Do you think a Rank Holder will spend time with Rank Holders who are focused on their goals of achieving Number 1 status in College, those who are studious and who love studies OR
- Do you think a Rank Holder will spend his time Dropouts, youngsters who are addicted to substances, those who have no interest in Education or in being the best?

Which one do you think makes more sense?

Remember - Mix Hot & Cold water and what do you think happens? Keep someone healthy with a bunch of unhealthy people - what do you think will happen? 

Keep this much in mind - Bankers hang around with Bankers, Scientists hang around with people of science, Bikers hang around with other fellow Bikers and Marathoners hang around with people who run Marathon. So what kinds of people you think Top Students would hang around with? In fact - ask yourself - What kinds of people would the parents of such Top Students would allow their children to be surrounded with?

**8. Smart Choices of Execution**
I get tons of ideas sent to me every single day on how to achieve a goal or a business or a new venture. And I always tell them one simple thing - Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything. For entering into the elusive world of being called a “Top Student” - its not just theories and plans that are focused upon - the execution of these plans are studied, researched and implemented. That is why some of the parents end up at my doorstep because they are searching for that ‘something new’ or that something ‘extra’ which will push their child towards success. 

So you must have ‘action’ and not just theory if you are looking to be a Top Student. And that action should be implemented not only by the Student but by the Parent also.

**9. The Power Habits**
How many times did you check your smartphone for notifications?
How many hours did you study?
What time did you wake up?
Which professor did you consult today?
How many classes have you attended during the year?

I have personally noticed that Top Students do not have any habits or engage in any activity that takes them out of their zone or away from their goals. 

You are a creature of your habits. And you cannot achieve any success in any endeavor if you do not have powerful habits. And Top Students have Powerful Habits.

**10. Self Evaluation Feedback Loop**
How would you know if a supplement offers you the benefits it says it delivers? How would you know if an exercise is truly helping you become better, faster, stronger and more competitive? How would you know if the new coach you appointed is the right coach for you?

You evaluate it through a test or you check it through constant & acute observations. 

Top notch Students constantly have tests and exams to know where they stand, how much they understood, what did they understand, where they weak points are and where they need to improve on. And it is not just one time but every single week and every single month that such tests are undertaken. 

The reason for this - they are very clear about the pace, the speed and the performance they are looking for. And just as if you had a terrible or miserable performance throughout the year during the trials - you cannot become a star suddenly on the day that it truly matters - in the same way Top Students ensure they are 100% battle tested every single moment.

 **11. Sacrifices**
I recently watched the Indian Movie Dangal (Dangal (film) - Wikipedia ) A very powerful and inspirational sports biopic staring Indian Superstar Aamir Khan where he narrates the story of how Mahavir Singh Phogat (played by Aamir Khan) ensures both his daughters become India’s first world-class female wrestlers. 

You should seriously watch the movie in its complete entirety. An exceptionally powerful movie. What I really loved about this movie was the depiction of how sacrifice was clearly shown to be the underlining factor that pushed this family and these two girls to achieve their dreams. 

I personally had moments of tears when watching this movie because it was so real. So the point I am trying to make here is - without sacrifices - truly heartbreaking and intensely blood churning sacrifices - you cannot - just cannot achieve success. Or for that matter become A Top Notch Student.

**12. The Extra Mile**
Even though I am not a Top Student where Academics is concerned, I consider myself a Top Student where my field of work is concerned which is Personal Branding, Communication & Peak Performance. And this has lead me from my simple humble beginning as an School Dropout Toilet Cleaner who started his career with nothing and no money - to being the World’s Best at what I do today - Personal Branding. And even though I am a South Indian with a South Indian accent - I have tutored and trained World Class Speakers. 

So how is this humanly possible?

It is possible because I followed one simple principle in life: 
“Never let anyone out prepare you”
If someone was practicing their speech 10 times, I choose to practice mine 100 times. If someone committed to 100 drafts, I would ensure my speech would go through 3,000 drafts. If I learnt that the industry standard while preparing a speech was 30 days before the actual speech performance - I would prepare my 365 days before the planned date. Such was my extreme planning, preparation & commitment. 

I never ever ever let anyone out-prepare me. And that is why I achieved success more than anyone else. 

If you can wake up and workout when the world is sleeping, if you can sacrifice all the pleasures of a good life just for your goal, if you can say no to others when everyone is calling you to have a good time because you need to focus on your goals - you my friend will achieve immortality.

 **13. Diet, Breathing & Meditation**
This may sound like a rather weird or unheard of combination. And to be honest, even I didn’t know this ingredient existed - however, once I started interacting with top-notch performers - I realized this was a very powerful component to the movers and shakers of our generation.

Most of the high performance achievers at Harvard, Yale & the top Ivy League schools are very particular what they eat, how much they eat and when they eat. Its not like they do not eat burgers, pizza’s and fries - but the majority are very particular about what they eat. And most of them eat to live - and not live to eat. Because end of the day - they have to get back to ‘work’. 

Where Breathing & Meditation is concerned - most of them given the amount of work they do - ensure they are able to reset their system and get back into the zone of work. And that is why they always spend time either Exercising light to ensure health and yes, Meditate to ensure their minds are fresh and powerful. 

There is nothing like having a powerful body and powerful mind as the ultimate combination.

**14. Routine**
I have stated this in almost every answer possible and nearly all successful have this particular ingredient - a Routine. 

If you haven’t read the routine I follow - here is the link:

To achieve that level of success - you must have a routine. Without this - forget it.

**15. Professional Coaching & Mentoring**
Sometimes I wish someone had told me how important this particular factor was - I really really really wish I knew this. Because had I known how powerful and impactful this particular aspect was towards success - I would have begged - literally begged my parents to get me a mentor. 

Almost ALL and I mean ALL successful people have mentors. If you have a mentor, with everything else being equal - your chance to success increases at least 1000% more than the person who doesn’t have a mentor. 

Need I say more?

 **16. Money Talks**
In the end - if there is one trait that is the most unfair and most painfully obvious - it would be this one - Money. Without money, you cannot get yourself into a world-class educational institute, you cannot get yourself world class facilities, you cannot get yourself a world-class mentor and you cannot get yourself into a world-class environment. Sad as it sounds - you need money to help you make more money. And without this - you will never - and I mean NEVER be able to achieve your dreams - at least easily. 

Yes, there have been students who have been awarded scholarships, but then again - how many do you think can boast of this rare privilege? And if you are looking forward to enter in Harvard or some top notch institute - do you see it being a cake-walk? 

You need this valuable resource. And it is only those who have planned for this day will be able to access and take advantage of the opportunities that present itself. Given the amount of competition, the number of people who want to succeed and the limited number of chances available - the person who has the money - will be able to take advantage than the person who doesn’t have any.

"Graduating from high school in May, need help figuring out what to do next.",7,7kzcde,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7kzcde/graduating_from_high_school_in_may_need_help/,7,"To keep it simple, i was always an unmotivated student who slacked really hard during my first two years in high school and scraped by with a 2.7 GPA, during my junior year i kinda decided to get it together and i managed to raise my GPA to 3.2. Now this year, as a senior, i've kicked my self into shape and pulled a 3.5 GPA out of sheer hard work (mind you these are unweighted). 

During my 10th grade year i scored a 950 on my PSAT (this was when i didn't care and didn't study so i'd take this grade with a grain of salt). For the last couple of weeks I've been studying for the SAT that i'll take in March (it's the latest i feel comfortable taking it) and I'm hoping to score at least a 1300 on it so that i can increase my chances of getting into my college of choice (University of Georgia). 

Now this is where i need some help. I don't know what to do as a major or how to even approach figuring it out. I did really well in all of my science classes, chemistry being my overall favorite. I also did really well in my economics class, i even achieved a perfect score on my teachers final, which he claimed hasn't happened for a few years. Lastly, i've finished the nursing pathway at my school and walked away scoring an 89% on the National Health Science Assessment, which was the highest grade in my class of twenty-seven students. 

I just feel as if i have so many options that i could pursue. I've got a few ideas of jobs that i wouldn't mind perusing such as an Actuary, Architecture, some form of Engineering discipline, something science related, or Pre-Med. 

I know that many people will say to just do what you think will make you happy, but no major makes me genuinely excited. I know it might seem selfish but the thing that makes me happy is being able to afford a nice quaint house with a decent car. Some people might scoff and say that you shouldn't pursue a job only for the money but getting the money will make me happy. 

I guess i just need people who've gone through similar tribulations to explain to me what they did and how to overcame this.","[""I've gone from wanting to be a music teacher, to a performance major, to an actuary, and finally settled on a comp sci/math major to go into mathematical finance. My advice, what I'm trying to do anyways, is to find a job or field that you KNOW you can succeed in, look into it, learn about all the jobs and all the options there are in that field, and decide what job you can see yourself being happy in. And if you can't find something like that, find a job that you can succeed in, or at least that you can tolerate (ie a job that isn't your dream job, but you don't necisarially have any problems with either/that would be a detriment for you).\n\nThe idea behind this is that work is work, no matter what you do, so you make the best out of it. Make the most money you can, so when you punch out at five, you can go home to your guy or your girl, have the things you want, be around the people you want, not have lack of money be something that drags you down in life, and just live the life you want to live without poverty dragging you down.\n\nI grew up watching my parents fail at getting the dream jobs they wanted and get dragged down by their debt (that is still overbearing to this day) and decided I never wanted to live like that.

Should I ditch WMU and head to CC for the next 2 years to save money?,1,946jbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/946jbf/should_i_ditch_wmu_and_head_to_cc_for_the_next_2/,4,"Hey! I’m a long-time lurker, first time poster on this sub and after debating for quite awhile I’ve come to seek out some advice. Be aware, this post may become lengthy so feel free to scroll to the bottom for the TLDR. 

Anyway, I’m a freshman this year starting at a four-year university (Western Michigan University). I leave for school in 21 days, where I will be staying on campus, but have been having major second thoughts about the whole thing. Originally when I decided to attend, I thought I was going to commute as it is only 40 minutes or so from my house and would save me a lot on housing. However, after visiting campus in June I impulsively decided to sign a contract so that I could stay on campus and get the “college experience”. I’ve talked to my roommate, bought stuff for our room, hell, even bought some used textbooks... but I’m not sure if I want to go here anymore when I could be saving thousands by attending community college. 

The reason for this boils down to a handful of very good reasons:
a. I’m currently undecided about what I truly want to pursue although my declared major was Advertising. 
b. I come from a family where attending CC is frowned upon (i.e. it used to be a fraudulent trap when my grandfather and mother pursed their undergraduate degrees and thus tainted their perception of community college). 
c. I don’t want to waste money/go into severe debt. 

Plain and simple, as a registered nurse my mom makes too much money and as a result, I didn’t qualify for much financial aid through FAFSA. I should also add that she is going to graduate school this fall, and unable to fund me at all as she still has to take care of my younger sister. I already took out both government-offered Stanford loans but it was not nearly enough to cover WMU’s cost of attendance. As a result, my mom decided to take out a $16,000 PLUS loan in her name. I not only hate the idea of it, but she’s also reiterated that she will not be able to do it next year, which while I agree with it, leaves me to wonder how else I can pay for college? 

I should also add that I believe I will be relatively successful at any institution I study at, but am scared about my future of potential debt. If I attend CC, I’ll transfer back and finish my degree but save a lot. On the flip side, I will miss out on the social side of things and likely regret the opportunity for self-growth while living away from home. On the flip side, however, I will be able to help my mom by staying at home and driving my sister around, etc. 

TLDR: About to leave for a 4-year university where I will incur an incredible amount of debt, but considering staying at home and attending CC for two years instead— thoughts? ","[""You need to ask yourself if giving up the social life at cc will be worth the money you'll be saving. Personally I'd save the money over any fun but I'm an introvert anyways.\n\nIf WMU is not your end goal and want to push for a more prestigious uni like U of M then CC is most def the way to go.\n\nI'm still at cc and just started on my transfer app but honestly WMU is not really worth all that money. Personal opinion ik but also since you're unsure I would follow the MTA at the cc and on the downtime see what interests you.\n\nNow as a fellow Michigaander, the Michigan Transfer Agreement covers your GEDs... Look over it and see if it makes sense to you.\n\nAlso feel free to pm me if you need any help.\nJust again know that CC is not going to be as glamorous and fun as uni which is why it's a mature decision to consider. :) \n\nWould type more but Mobile"", ""Okay, you're moving in 21 days. It's a little late to change it. Make the most of your time there."", ""If you can back out now then do it. How are you going to be able to afford the next semester? You'll be back at the CC anyways might as well save the money now.\n\nSide note, Ill be attending WMU down in FL lol. Kinda nervous about being on my own for the first time. Being in the Army didn't really count as being on my own. Since its a satellite campus I won't really have the full university experience. "", ""I know it's late but honestly I'm really glad I went to a cc first and only incurred debt my last two years.\n\n&#x200B;""]",8/3/18 8:27
How to deal with sleep deprivation in college?,5,6ysyqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6ysyqh/how_to_deal_with_sleep_deprivation_in_college/,9,"I've started typing this as of 11:49 pm. I have to get up at 6am for class. Given the circumstances, I don't think I am going to be falling asleep anytime soon, so I thought I would make this topic. I am struggling to deal with sleep deprivation, as I imagine thousands of other students are. I am wondering how to deal with it. (TLDR at bottom)

Now, there is not one cause of my lack of sleep I can pin point. There are many causes I can think of. I will list the biggest ones, starting with ""mental"" barriers if you will.

I am a freshman Civil Engineering student, have an on campus job, and am in band. The workload I have been faced with is admittedly more than I really anticipated. 

With the engineering course load, and in addition, my extracurricular/non academic activities, I'm feeling an immense amount of stress. I'm falling behind in coursework because I have so little time to do it. I have *enough* time to do it. But that would mean almost every bit of spare time I have, while accounting for a solid 8 hours of sleep a night, would be dedicated to homework and studying. 

I just don't have the motivation to do all of that, every day, every week, nonstop. I can't find room to do something I *enjoy* and unwind without losing sleep. And without having at least and hour or 2 of that time, I would lose my mind. So as a result I stay up pretty late doing homework (12-1am). This leads to less sleep of course, which in turn makes me stressed and slower in my studies, which makes it harder to sleep, which makes me stressed and so on and so forth. The outcome is getting behind in what I should be doing.

Now, the stress and anxiety I deal with is not purely caused by the lack of sleep (which in turn leads to academic problems). As ""cliche"" as this whole thing sounds, another major factor is worrying about making friends. I don't really care about looking like I have friends, I want to make actually friends, but I don't really have the confidence to put myself out there. When I am doing homework alone in my dorm and hear people laughing and having fun, I feel motivated to just go out there, you know? But then that feeling is suppressed when I realize how much work I need to get done, and it feels like a waste of time to try to make friends when  I know that I won't have time to be with them. When I'm doing homework in my room, I feel like  such a loser. My lack of self confidence doesn't  help with that either. And that leads to more stress, so on, so forth.

And finally, another factor of my loss of sleep is within the dorm room itself. My roommate goes to bed at least by 12 am every night, and that's when he has 8 am classes.  He is usually on his computer,( as he is doing now) emitting the bright, blinding light directly towards my bed. But alas there is a solution! A sleep mask! But only if it was that simple. The sleep mask blocks out the light, but my roommate has no consideration for me. He has had a runny nose for the past couple of days. He won't blow his nose. What he does practically every waking hour (including right now) sniff in the most annoying way possible. He does it in a kind of rhythm, which somehow makes it worse. 

Of course, I have tried to communicate to him about it in the least passive aggressive way I can. Either he likes sniffing the snot up his nose or just forgets that he's bothering me. I'm not his parent, and unfortunately can't put him in time out unless he stops or whatever  Dealing with that while trying to sleep is a whole other challenge. His habits are infinitely harder to deal with on Friday nights, when I have to get up at 5am some Saturdays to go to the football games (recall that I'm in band, and they have insanely early call times for morning/afternoon games). He will often go to bed at 2 or 3.

The last (and biggest) thing that my roommate does that is preventing me from sleeping is not getting up when his alarm goes off. By that I mean he will have a class at 9am, and set his alarm for 6:30. He won't actually get out of his bed until 8:45am. I kid you fucking not, he will crawl out of his bed, put on his shoes and walk to class. He then tells me about he gets there last minute and has to run (gee, I wonder why!) During that period of 2+ hours he will be snoozing his alarm, which is this annoying little song thing.

This isn't much of a problem when I have 8 am classes 3 times a week, because I get up at 6 to take a shower and get some work done, then leave at around 7:30. So only about an hour listening to his alarm while I'm awake.  Could be worse. The REAL problem happens when I have a chance to sleep in for once, but that opportunity is taken away when I wake up with his alarm. So I end up still getting at most 6 hours of sleep when I have the opportunity to get 10. I try to go back to sleep when he leaves for class, but usually it's very light sleep. I have talked to him a few times about setting his alarm later. I bet you can guess if that worked or not. I don't get how he can be so unaware. I wish he would put himself in my shoes 

The final problem in my dorm is the commotion. I live *right* next to the common room area on my floor, which can be loud at times because that is where everyone gathers to be social. But that is really only during the week day and week end nights. The people who live a door down from us around very loud. Right now it's around 1 am on a Friday morning, and they have girls and people across the hall over, *running* down the hall and creating a commotion (as of 12:47am, someone is clapping their hands outside of my door). Quite hours began at 11 pm. This isn't a daily occurrence, but it happens enough that it is worth mentioning and is definitely contributing to my deprivation.

That's really about it. When combining all of this, it is really hard for me to sleep. Maybe 4-6 hours a night. Over the summer I slept 9-10 hours, which is what I function best on. This is causing my stress and anxiety to go through the roof, and I can't focus on anything. I can't imagine being able to do this all year, but if I have to, then I will need to figure out how live with it. I don't know if I need to take a medication or what. I have been researching about drugs to take that will enhance my brain, but most of them are prescription drugs.

Thanks for reading this really long post, that I doubt anyone really cares about (it's waaaaay longer than I thought it was going to be) as everyone has their own battles to deal with. I pretty much poured it out in this post. I guess you could call it venting

TL;DR: I get barely any sleep due to tons of different factors, and it doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. How does one succeed in university with minimal sleep?","['You wrote quite an essay. I got a few ideas that might help you. You mentioned your dorm mate has his clock go off and keeps you up from light. A suggestion that I would try is a nice face mask and ear plugs. I used to work overnight and this was the only way I could sleep during the day. Ear plugs drown out a good bit of light and the face mask should drown out every bit of light. I suggest these things because I doubt you can reason with your dorm mate. They likely don\'t even listen to their parents so it\'s not too far fetched of an idea to believe that they don\'t give a rats about you and your sleep.\n\nNext issue is that you want to get lots of sleep. I don\'t know what your schedule is but that\'s probably not going to happen on your schedule. If you\'re a student, have a job and involved in band it\'s just not going to happen. Currently you\'re living a lifestyle that will not allow for extra time. 6-7 hours is about what I get every night if I\'m lucky. I work 40 hours, take 3 classes and I have a wife so I don\'t have any real time off to do anything. I make it work with the time that I have but there\'s little to no down time. Your only options are to either decrease your obligations or embrace them. \n\nIn regards to the ""brain enhancing drugs"" you need to stay off whatever site that is because those are not a thing. There are certain people with genetic mutations that allow for them to get less sleep and function better than others. Richard Branson, Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Oprah are great examples of high functioning adults that operate on less than 6 hours of sleep. Everybody has a different amount of sleep necessary for them to be successful, however you don\'t need to sleep less than 6 hours to be like those people. Bill Gates and Neil Patel both sleep 7~ hours and are very high functioning adults that are overwhelming successful. If you live a very physically demanding life or face overwhelming mental exhaustion you need to listen to your body and give it the sleep that it\'s asking for.\n\nIf you truly want to get the most out of your time, you need to find out how to get your body to operate at it\'s peak efficiency. A very simple idea but difficult practice is to not do what the overwhelming majority of society does. Get ample (7 hours minimum) sleep, eat clean food, move away from sugary carbonated caffeine drinks, work out, and give yourself time to have guilt free pleasure. If you choose to do even a few of those things you will be ahead of the vast majority of society. You will feel tremendously better from having a well rested body and healthy organs. If you\'re stressed out I would even suggest journaling for even a brief period of time because it\'s a great mental relief. \n\nI hope this helps.', ""First off, I can see right away that you have a lot going through your mind. If you didn't, you wouldn't have wrote this when you needed to sleep. The first thing you want to do when trying to get to sleep is really clearing your mind, relaxing, and easing both your body and mind into a place where you're ready to sleep. Have you tried meditation, soft music, nature sounds, videos, etc.?\n\nAs far as making friends, if you have to do your work as well, try talking to people in your classes. Get to know them. Maybe you can form study groups in the library where you can be with others but still get your work done. I would also see if there are any engineering clubs where you can connect with other students in your major. A club like this could be a great academic, social, and professional resource. Additionally, check out r/EngineeringStudents.\n\nHow serious of a time commitment is band practice? Would you consider cutting that from your schedule if you could devote more time to sleep, leisure time, or making friends? You might have to make some sacrifices here. What kind of on-campus job do you have? Can you get less hours? Can you study or do homework while on the job? If not, can you get a campus job that will allow you to? \n\nI second the advice about a sleep mask and noise cancelling ear plugs. Do your research and see what's the best you can buy. You could also try getting a fan to turn on at night if the sound is soothing to you, or fall asleep to nice relaxing music/sounds/videos. Limit how much you look at your phone or computer before bed. Screens keep you up. Resist looking at your phone when you need to go to bed if you can't sleep. It will only hurt you. Take melatonin or a sleeping pill if you *really* need to be knocked out (don't overuse these). Cut out caffeine and any particular food or drinks that will keep you up in the hours leading up to bedtime. \n\nI would also talk to your floor RA about your roommate and the people near you who are violating quiet hours. See if there's anything they can do. Also think about what you could do yourself - would you consider looking at other rooms or roommates to transfer who could be more respectful of your sleep and match your schedule better?\n\nGetting up at 6 AM when you have a class at 8 AM seems too early to me, especially when you say you're not getting enough sleep. It sounds like you live on campus, so you can get to class pretty quickly. When I had an 8 AM, I could get up at 7:15-7:20 and still make it to class. I didn't shower in the morning, and I could get ready in 10-20 minutes. Getting to class was only a 10 minute walk. It was more than doable. If you shower, try getting up at 7 and make it fast. That extra hour of sleep should really help. To make getting ready easier in the morning, lay out your clothes and prepare your books and bag for the next day before you go to sleep the previous night. Take a breakfast bar, muffin, or fruit (something quick) if you need something to eat while you're heading out the door. \n\n"", ""The reality is really that you just get used to it in the long run. \n\nI'm in physics and maths, and running off of 4-5 hours of sleep a night for more weeks than I can count now. It's probably been close to 3 years since I keep working through the breaks as well. \n\nYou can:\n\n - try to optimize your daily routine better and get a few more minutes free, \n\n - look into ways to study more efficiently,\n\n - sleep with earplugs and invest in good noise-cancelling headphones for the rest of the time, and\n\n - either accept that you're going to be socializing less than most others, or set your bar lower for grades. "", ""So much text, and I'll admit I didn't read it all. But to free up a LITTLE of your schedule, I suggest dropping band. You have some issues with your roommate they you're just gonna have to bring up bluntly (but not douchey) with him. Some people just need to get hit with a truth sledgehammer because there is no beating around the bush with them lol. \n\nIt sounds to me like most of your insomnia is anxiety. You WILL make friends. All it takes is a simple conversation starter with people on your floor, in class, or just walking around. Join in on that conversation about how Catan is the best game ever, ask to sit at a table with other students you know are into gaming, go to that campus party, ask what the plan is for the weekend when you have free time to socialize. I don't know how old you are, but I met TONS of friends while drinking when I was in the military. One of my best friends to this day that I still talk to even though I'm not in anymore, we met while shitfaced and I was wearing a Queen shirt and he mentioned that he also loved Queen lol, and a group of us (strangers at the time) were literally just standing there yelling at each other about how awesome Queen are. Put yourself out there! \n\nYou chose a difficult major and you will have to put in the time to get through it. Find yourself a good balance and routine and you should be fine. \n\nOh yeah, GET OFF YOUR COMPUTER! I have stayed up for 2 days straight with no sleep because I'd be on my computer doing everything. It is constant stimulation, I've learned to just turn it off. If you're up late you can also just take some Night Time medicine, it's helps me out a lot. "", ""Hey OP I know sleep deprivation sucks but you can do a few things to help \n1. Workout high intensity before bed just bang out some push-ups and sit-ups and a hot shower will make you rack out pretty quick\n2. Talk to your roommates about the problems and don't be afraid to be upfront about it.\n3. We'll this sounds harsh but you can actually get used to it this is my 8th month on deployment and I have been able to run on very minimal to no sleep pretty well ""]",9/8/17 9:59
How do I get over the weird feeling of being a fifth year senior?,4,6bsh1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6bsh1s/how_do_i_get_over_the_weird_feeling_of_being_a/,14,"I got really depressed/couldn't sleep mid-way through college and had to retroactively pull out of a semester. I feel really weird having to stay an extra year, partly because I feel uncomfortable giving the real reason why I stayed back a year. 

Further, all of my friends think I just failed out of a semester and think that I'm using the sleeping issues as an excuse for just performing poorly and smoking a lot of weed (I was known for it, but in honesty I kind of turned to drugs for self-medication). I also do lots of stupid shit, am regularly late for things, and generally disorganized (though I'm good with grades), so it's not surprising to my friends that I am (read: was but not anymore - I have a f*kn 3.7) doing bad in school. 

I could join other clubs, but honestly, and this sounds douchey, most of the people at my school are kind of dumb. Maybe not dumb, but I tried to hang out with a bunch my freshman year and they were all a little bland. This likely isn't objectively true - I probably just didn't vibe with them. Unfortunately, the group of people that I do relate to now doesn't like me for reasons previously mentioned. Honestly, they were the people I related to *the most*. 

Further, even if I did hang out with new people, it's not likely that my parents will really care for them. As asian parents, they have a very specific requirement for friends they approve. As a result, even if I do form some meaningful relationships (which is not likely, as I've already tried with numerous groups), they're not the type that I can bring home to my parents (this sounds weird, but you know what I mean. Your best friends are supposed to become like family. Except mine..)

Wait...you wouldn't fight for a better grade?,30,4b01cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4b01cz/waityou_wouldnt_fight_for_a_better_grade/,13,"I'm taking Statistics and PreCalculus at the same time, both online with the same instructor (along with 3 gen ed classes - I have no life this semester).  There is no real instruction in the math classes - it's all self-led learning with assignments and tests given via that ""fun"" math app, MyMathLab.  (I HATE MyMathLab...but that's another rant.)  Thank god for college professors posting their lectures on YouTube or I would have died in Stats a LONG time ago.

I took the 2nd set of tests 3 weeks ago and was surprised to see that a certain tool that was supposed to be available to us on the Stats test was not there, so I crashed and burned on 2 questions.  Yes, I still got an A (93%) BUT it could have been better!  So, I emailed my instructor, asking why the tool was not available on the system.  He immediately admitted to his own mistake (he forgot to turn on access to the tool when he set up the tests) and gave me the points for those 2 questions, which popped my grade up by 5 percentage points.  That's half a freaking grade!  WOOT!

Later that day, I was telling a good friend about the test, the email discussion with my instructor and how I got back half a grade on the test just by asking a question.  Instead of being happy for me, she called me a perfectionist and said, ""You got an A!  Who cares if it's a low A or a high A!  You shouldn't have bothered your professor for 5 measly percentage points!""

WTF?!?!?!?!  Seriously!?!?!?  You'd just take the grade you got and leave it at that?  I mean, really, the worst that can happen is that the prof tells you no, right?

The good news is, with those ""5 measly percentage points"" and getting high A's on the first set of tests and low A's on the 3rd set, I just have to make a 67% on the 4th set to get an A in both.  That fact alone made the stress begin to lift off my shoulders.  I may actually get to enjoy this last bit of my math classes.....AND keep some of my sanity!  YAH!","['I would. There have been times where that 5 percent was enough to bump me from a 3.9 to a 4.0. In fact, that happened to me last quarter.

', ""Pick your battles.  It's fine to dispute grades when they're wrong but another less numerical thing you want to do in college is to build relationships with professors and classmates. Sometimes it's good to know when a grade matters, or when it's won't affect your final grade and isn't worth disturbing calm waters over.\n\nLetters of recommendation, lab assistant opportunities and honors club inductions don't just happen.  Those relationships have to be built up first. \n\nThe social/political aspect of college isn't something you want to ignore, even if it's annoying sometimes. If a grade is likely to impact your final letter grade (and therefore GPA), fight it every time.

I got bad grades this semester,2,7mgjxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7mgjxg/i_got_bad_grades_this_semester/,4,"So i’m not going to make any excuses for myself because it’s clearly my fault. I’m in my junior year and it’s my first semester at a university (first two years were in CC). I didn’t realize university would be this hard. I was used to cruising in CC. My grades this semester were:
Business Statistics 2: D
Intermediate Accounting: C+
Managerial Economics: C+
Marketing 310: B-
Supply Chain Management 310: B
introduction to Accounting Profession: B

I’m usually an A and B student but this semester was just weird. No matter how hard I studied I would always just get a bad grade on exams. This led me to not caring anymore as my self-esteem went down and everyone around me seemed to do way better than me. Making me feel like I was dumb. My studying methods consisted studying a few days ahead of the exam, using flashcards, doing practice problems till i would get them right, read through parts of the chapter i didn’t understand. I realized that i should have actually been doing this weeks ahead rather than days ahead. I should’ve been studying everyday. However, it seems like everyone i talked to in my classes were doing the same methods as me and they were doing better than I was. Maybe I’m the type of person who gets things slower? My life is such a mess right now. Because of how low my grades were this semester, it would put me around a 2.4 GPA. I need a 2.5 to get into the school of business at my university but now I won’t since i didn’t meet the GPA requirement. I have to do better in spring and try to get in the fall of my senior year. I guess this is a lesson learned on how to take university much more seriously.","[""People often lie about how much they really study.

Some beautiful motivational words from my SI leader I thought were worthy of sharing!,6,8hfws2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8hfws2/some_beautiful_motivational_words_from_my_si/,0,"Before we depart on each of our paths of life, I want to offer you some words. 

This is YOUR life. You can make it anything you want. Do not let people that sit in an office and tell you that your not able to do something. Tenacity and fortitude tell much about a person, be the person that gets through to the other side, people can ignore those who fail, you can ignore those who don't care, but at the end of the day when your fighting for what you want, people have to notice. 

Plans are good, but detailed plans will let you down. Don't be fooled by the construct of ordered life. The pattern of ""success"" that is outlined by our parents and family. Graduate high school, go to college, get a job, get married, have a family. This is so arbitrary and it hurts so many people. Love does not chose when to enter your life, your destiny does not enter your mind in way that gives you this pattern. LIVE first, plan in detail second. You can plan to go from point A to B. But every time you plan each step you will be disappointed because life NEVER goes according to plan. Live every moment like it can teach you something. Don't get caught up in what other people are doing, be open to new ideas and live for your happiness, comparing yourself to someone else is trying to argue that apples are oranges are the same. Live your life, keep going from point A to B, but live it in-between. Yourself worth is in you, not if you get into professional school or not. Ask yourself this: would I love myself just as much if a failed to become a (insert profession)? Most people say no, and this is really a hard thing, because this weighs on everyone who goes through the anxiety of getting to the next step. At the end of the day, you will all be on forward path, the more you begin to separate yourself, the more you will succeed. 

The goal of learning is not to get an ""A"". I think school has failed us in this regard. We measure our level of intelligence off of this A.The more you focus on the ""A"" and not the class, you waste your time, your money, and the information that you could have learned. Focus on understanding and the A will come naturally, your attitude will increase, and it becomes easier to learn in the long run. 

I sincerely wish you all the best. Don't give up, if you faltered this semester or year, you have two years to reclaim your learning. Most importantly NEVER give up, the difference between great people and average people is that when they both fail, one rejects failure and ignores its presence because it will hurt self image or the work required becomes daunting. The other accepts it as a cornerstone of life and embraces it and cures weakness.

Always leave someone in a better state than you found them. A drop of positivity in this ecosystem of complaining and negativity is well needed. Make the best of reality. 

Good luck, I hope you all find what your looking for, it has been fun and rewarding and I appreciate all that I have learned from you all!

But while visiting home and hanging out with my group of close friends again all those problems went away for a short while.

I realize now that I was acting different at home than here at college. I was my old self again.

I used to be a fun and extroverted guy who just wanted to be friends with everyone and I didn't care what anyone thought about me. I was confident in myself and I was happy.

Now I'm acting way more introverted and wanting to have just a few people I might be able to be close friends with. I'm more concerned about what people will think of me and am constantly comparing myself to others (everyone seems to bond easier, act more confident, adjust better etc). I'm not confident in myself and I am not happy.

24 year old educational late bloomer and STEM major with poor early GPA. How to get ahead for more promising prospects? Potentially TL;DR,17,5id0iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5id0iu/24_year_old_educational_late_bloomer_and_stem/,4,"I'm not sure if this is the proper place for this or the right format since I seem to be a story teller. I scoured reddit for where to post this and this seemed like the most relevant subreddit. Please let me know if it's not and I apologize if this is inappropriate and TL;DR.

I'm a 24F, long story short, poor self esteem and depression put me off at a bad start. I live in California and am from a middle class family so I've always had proper resources at my finger tips so that's never been a problem. I just never had any hobbies early on in high school, had a poor GPA, never joined any clubs, etc. My parents are very successful, but didn't know how to handle me and I was always a disappointment. 

When I graduated from high school, my plan was to attend community college and then transfer. My original plan was to major in architecture so I can go the route of sustainable architectural design. The first few years out of high school I continued to have a poor start. Let's just say I wasn't super motivated, I was still depressed, worked odd jobs, had no hobbies, no real friends, and I moved a lot from living with one family member to the next (got kicked out of 2, left 1) I took college classes here and there but had poor grades because I didn't care and wasn't trying. If anything, I regret even starting college until sorting myself out. Because I kept moving community colleges I'd have to start off with lame sort of nothing classes just to get into the college. Luckily some did satisfy IGETC/general ed courses, but due to poor planning I repeated some requirements. Finally, my mom invited me to live with her and I started attending one of the top community colleges in California. I don't mean to get super dark here, but I attempted suicide in February 2014, when I was 21. After that I had a resurgence of hope and motivation and never thought about suicide again. I got serious about my classes but I was still doing poorly with improvement (I went from an F to a C student. Yippee). I didn't see a counselor and took some extra classes I didn't need. Failed one or two classes and merely passed a few others. I finally took an architect related class required for the major and part way through the class realized it wasn't for me. I did enjoy some aspects of the class though, such as group collaboration, innovation, problem solving, using computers, etc. I was doing pretty okay but something just didn't feel right. I just didn't see myself doing architecture in particular for the rest of my life.

While I was never good at math in high school, probably because I fell so far behind, I got a chance to start over when I tested into College Algebra. I was succeeding and grades were improving. I called back on my desire to study astronomy and physics (I actually did ok in high school physics, but my laziness when it came to homework gave me a B in the class). However, I imagined I had to be a natural genius to do it. I have a somewhat high IQ, but I thought my poor start left me as a waste of potential and I was doomed to mediocrity. Meanwhile, after years of trying different antidepressants I was diagnosed as being on the ""bipolar spectrum"" and having generalized anxiety. Still not sure what it means exactly, but I was put on a mood stabilizer and go to therapy for my anxiety for coping skills and I began to feel like an actual person again. Not everything is perfect, but my baseline mood isn't feeling like nothing. I feel like a different person. I feel curious and like experimenting with everything. I like solving problems, puzzles, and knowing how things work. I turned myself into an A student when it comes to mathematics. I realized I had nothing to lose, so I saw a counselor, told him I'm not 100% sure what I want to do exactly yet, but I'm interested in Physics and Engineering. I decided to go with physics for now since most of the classes for physics and engineering majors to transfer to UC schools overlap.

So far I've gotten up to Calculus 2, I've taken a prep for general chemistry course, and a intro to programming course (which I absolutely loved). I've done quite well and I feel accomplished and proud. My family tells me how proud they are of me for the first time in my life. 

I took my first Physics course this semester. Should have checked Rate My Professor though because apparently I took the worst one. Then I got my textbook shipped to me late and fell behind. My professor had a thick accent and I developed vision problems so I couldn't read the board or follow anything. I got my textbook eventually and a pair of glasses but I fell too far behind. I enjoyed what I WAS learning and knew it was possible, but it wasn't a good class. One of my classmates was a straight A student and said this was the first class he was going to fail. I tried anyways but decided to swallow my pride and drop the class because I couldn't just get a C. It meant damaging my already poor overall GPA and just ""kind of"" understanding the information when I wanted to master it. I'm all signed up for next semester with the best professor in the department and I'm not signed up of anything else so I have time to really study it and understand the material for a good foundation. I've done all kinds of reading on how to succeed in physics classes, I'm reading and watching lectures online, and I'm so ready for this.

But now that I have my sob story out of the way, here-in lies my problem. I'm trying to follow the TAG plan to transfer to a UC school. Even though I'm rocking it right now in terms of grades, my early GPA was SO poor that my overall GPA is a 2.67 (my transfer GPA to this CC is 1.94...yikes). From what I understand I need at least a 3.0 to qualify for transferring to my college of choice. As far as my major goes, I only have 2 more math courses and 3 physics courses (so 3 semesters) until I'm eligible to transfer. I'm so scared I'm never going to make that up. I beat myself up if I noticed I'm only going to get a B because I feel like anything less than an A will set me back. I feel like I can't make up for my past sins and no matter what I do I'm going to fail. And because of this I will never have a competitive enough GPA to get into a good grad school or qualify for internships and I'm destined to get a job I don't like, even if it is in physics or computer science. It doesn't help that I'm not 100% sure what I want to do specifically. Physics is interesting and I would LOVE to have a career related to space. In my free time I've been trying to teach myself programming. I've considered taking more programming classes even classes in electrical engineering/robotics to contribute to my GPA and open up my options but at the same time I feel like I'm just spinning wheels. I'm 24 and still in community college and I want to transfer so bad. I've been working at the same coffee shop for 2 years and I'm day dreaming about the day I get to leave. I'm just at a loss about how to get myself ahead and have a promising and happy future. I want to contribute to big things and work on teams to contribute something better to humanity. How do I get myself OUT of this hole and move forward?

**TL;DR:**
I sucked early in life and have a bunch of worthless classes on my transcript and a poor early GPA. Doing well now and I'm taking STEM classes (physics major track) at my community college. Still have only a 2.67 because of my early college career. Only 3 semesters of classes left that I need and I need AT LEAST a 3.0 to qualify for TAG (California UC school transfer agreement if you're not familiar). I'm proud of my accomplishments but I still feel I will never make up for my failures. How can I get ahead?","['[deleted]', ""Honestly nobody gives a shit how old you are.

Losing points off grade when you miss class: Opinions on this policy.,15,1r6no1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1r6no1/losing_points_off_grade_when_you_miss_class/,38,"This is my biggest pet peeve with instructors. I'm not sure if this happens at larger schools or if it's just a community college phenomena due to smaller class sizes.

I personally believe it's the student's responsibility to show up, and if they do poorly than that's their own fault.

I'm in two classes this semester. Statistics and Spanish. We lose points for missing Spanish, but in Statistics we don't get docked.

Now, I've only missed Stats once because I was sick. I've gotten an A on all four tests (except one)...she drops the lowest anyways and I knew that test would be my dropped one. Anyways, the point is I know that I have to attend this class in order to get a good grade.

On the other hand, I don't need to attend Spanish ever class meeting. This is subject material I understand and can self study. Again I have gotten an A on all tests/quizzes, but I don't owe that to showing up to class every time, because I haven't. I missed 3 classes (meets twice a week), and now, because of that, I'm at risk of getting a B instead of an A.

There's nothing more frustrating than working hard and earning an A on every assignment/test and losing 'participation points' because I'm a shy person and don't care to volunteer, or because I miss a class.

What is your opinion on this policy?

","[""I was in the same boat my Freshman year with a Spanish class. The reason they want you to show up is for the conversational part of it. For most, the class is the only place people actually practice speaking the language with others. But, I also disagree that attendance/participation should not be a part of your grade. I'm usually not one to raise my hand often in class, and it cost me a grade. Aced all tests, etc. I don't agree with it, but in the case of a foreign language class, I understand their reasoning."", ""Here's my perspective as a professor.  During my first five semesters of teaching I was totally on board with docking students points for not showing up.  I measured my performance by how well the students were performing on exams, and on average students performed better if I was a dick about attendance.  This is a massive oversimplification of very complex numbers built on memory alone but, if I was a prick about attendance students would finish with an average score of 78%, and if I didn't care they'd come in at around 72%.\n\nAnd so I thought that being a prick about attendance was part of being a good teacher.  After all, student outcomes were the true measure of a teacher's skill.\n\nOne day two of my colleagues argued with me about this, stating that while I could make students attend class, I couldn't make them give a single shit about what I was teaching.  And I paid attention to their perspectives, because they were offered to me at the end of a semester where I experienced the worst student-teacher interactions of my career, in a course where I made student attendance absolutely obligatory.\n\nSo my new rule is that attendance is irrelevant.  I'll work hard at making class as interesting as possible if you decide to come.  If you don't give a shit then you'll probably get ruined on the exams, but that's your problem, not mine."", ""Freshman year, I had to take classes for my then-major with a very strict professor.  Two unexcused absences, you dropped a letter grade; four, and you failed.  If you were 5 minutes late to class, you weren't allowed in the room.  \n\nI liken it to a job.  You need to be consistent about showing up to your job, and showing up on time.  School is your job right now.  If you are sick or out of town, you should notify your professor.  "", ""I don't have time to track that crap. I have colleagues who take off a certain number of points for every tardy even, and will fail a student after five absences. Fuck tracking that.\n\nAt my old job I was required to keep track of attendance and turn it in to the school because many of our students were on the maximum amount of federal aid allowable and we had to keep very close records for that reason. If they missed two weeks straight they were auto-dropped from the class. \n\nThere is also a lot of documentation and research that proves students that attend class are far more likely to pass and end up getting a degree, so there is a good reason to require class attendance.\n\nDespite that, there were classes I never went to except for exams in college. As long as a student is getting good grades I don't worry about them. If you are skipping a lot and failing you will hear from me though. "", ""I'd agree if it was basically any class but a language. In a foreign language, speaking the language itself should be a portion of the grade. It's notoriously difficult to test, though, so instead the professors use participation/attendance to make sure that you're speaking and learning how to pronounce things or hold the most basic of conversations. Being able to write and read is good, but speaking is important too. Attendance serves an important function in a foreign language course."", ""I think whether attendance should be a grade or not depends on the size and type of material. If it's a huge Intro class that is only lecture, then I don't think mandating attendance is necessary. However, if a class is smaller and more discussion-based, then I feel that it's more appropriate since the quality of the class depends on people being there. Then there are subjects such as foreign languages in which you have to practice in order to be fluent. \n\nFYI, just because you can ace language tests doesn't mean you can actually speak and understand it fluently. I was one of the top students in my high school Latin class but I would have never been able to actually have a conversation in Latin.

I am all done with my skills demonstrations and have 4 hours left to sit in there and study them. I could ask questions of the instructors there (typically one, sometimes two vs. 1-15 students at any given time).\n\nIn  contrast I have an anatomy class that is separated into lab and lecture components. VERY often, lab is shortened considerably and the lecture portion is performed there (the seats are stools with wheels and not the most conducive for posture or paying attention to an hour of powerpoint, but thats not even the big issue). When lecture time comes up, we are consistently released two hours early. This is time that could be easily used to expand on lectures and actually educate us. I also would be fine without this lecture (I took a very similar class to this before) and currently do well on tests/ assignments.\n\nFuck attendance', ""My opinion doesn't matter, its on the syllabus, its what happens.\n\nThere are plenty of schools where professors cant grade attendance."", 'One of the professors in my department (math) fails you if you miss more than 3 of the weekly tutorials.', 'In graduate school participation is one of the core grading matrix.

My roommate has been annoying,0,7brvr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7brvr1/my_roommate_has_been_annoying/,2,"I live in a suite with me and my roommate and then two suitemates.

I met my roommate through a group chat and we have a large group of friends in a GC, and we all hang out.  Recently I found out that my roommate apparently has problems with me through mutual friends.  Supposedly she has been telling everyone that I'm ""mean to her"" and ignore her all the time.  Let me note that I am actually very nice to her.  I am a blunt person and have little emotion, but in no way am I rude or mean to her regularly (with the exception of once but I'll explain that later.).  She is extremely emotional and sensitive (I can tell that she was babied), and I try to be as comforting as I can with her, but I just have a harder time dealing with emotional people.  She has told my friends that I am too blunt, as well.

HOWEVER, I put up with a LOT living with her- things that I should go off on her for, but don't.  I'll give a few examples.

-I left for a weekend, she had mutual friends over, and one of them, her best friend, accidentally took my foundation that I didn't give consent for her to use in the first place.  So she was letting her use MY stuff w/o asking.

-She made me stay out at 1 am because she had a guy over once

-She thinks that just because I said that she can use something once, it's a free pass to use it (i.e. my belts or shirts)

-She used my earbuds solely because they were ""on her side"" of the room and she ""thought they were hers"" (note: they were not on her side and she doesn't even have the same adapter for hers)

-She stole my earbuds for 3 days. I asked her if she knew where they were, she said no.  At 2 am 3 days later, I asked if I could use hers so I could watch a video. She gives them to me, says ""make sure they're not yours"" (which they were!!) and nonchalantly gives them back to me as if nothing happened

-Not me, but she uses my suitemate's clothes w/o asking and comes up with excuses 

-Told my friends that I was mean to her and lied about me ignored her texts about me taking her somewhere, when I DID respond the MINUTE she texted me

-Blames things that she does on the fact that she has a lot going on in her life w/ her health (reoccurring reproductive issues) and stress

So my friend informed me that she always complains about me and how I'm ""mean"" to her, won't let her play her music (we listen to different types of music.  I listen to rap and she listens to rock.  But MIND YOU I always let her borrow *MY* speaker to play her music in the shower!!).  My friends have asked her why she hasn't confronted me if I'm that ""mean"" to her and she said she doesn't want to cause conflict.  I think that she just lies about me being mean to her just to have something to talk about, considering that she's a generally confrontational person.  

*Anyway, here's what I was genuinely rude about.
We were watching TV w/ my suitemates and some of their friends. My roommate brings up that she wants to do spells and get tarot cards, do this four corners thing, get an ouija board.  She knows that this stuff is against my Christian beliefs and that it makes me uncomfortable, but she thinks it's all a joke and all cute (she should know better since she went to a Catholic school).  Anyway, basically I got really mad and snappy about how I don't want demons in my dorm and she got all defensive.  I admit that I was pretty rude but she was disrespecting my space and beliefs that she was aware about.

The issue is that I didn't think there were any issues until OUTSIDE PEOPLE told me about her issues with me!! I wish she would just tell me.

In the group chat today, however, we were talking about something and she says, and I quote,
""(me) is so blunt lol I love it"" ""Like, if i have a problem she always tells me the truth"" (literally... so which one is it... do you like me being blunt or do you not)

I REALLY want to move in with my friend (who is roommates with my roommate's best friend), so we could just switch and have this all settled.  But my friend and I don't know how to bring it up without causing drama.  So how could we go about this?

ALSO, if I do end up staying with my current roommate, what should I do? Should I confront her about all of this? Overall, I have concluded that she is generally pretty self-centered and only cares about herself and how she feels.  I feel like something needs to be said because she is out lying about me and my character, thinking I don't know.  I just don't know how to bring it up or what to say, and I'm worried that if I do bring it up and it escalates, I'll bring up every wrong thing she's done to me.","['>  Should I confront her about all of this? \n\nYes you should confront her about this. Do it in a calm and nice way. Don\'t use statements that make things seem like it\'s her fault, such as ""You do this...."" It\'s best to say it like ""I end up feeling used and disrespected when you use my stuff without asking."" Use the time to also set some clear boundaries about your stuff and etc. if you want. \n\nIf she STILL gets upset and tries to cause drama after you bring it up nicely and calmly without blaming her, then your relationship with her is more than likely toxic. By that point I would room with your friend instead. Still try to be as nice as you can no matter what but also be assertive about what you\'re not okay with if she oversteps the boundaries. ', 'Def just try to move so the situation doesn’t get worse and either way I️ would confront about some of the stuff']",11/9/17 10:34
Statistics vs. College Algebra?,3,3ub3hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3ub3hx/statistics_vs_college_algebra/,10,"Hey guys!  So, I'm a 30-something single mom of two.  I'm not working right now - instead, I'm spending my days taking care of my kids and my elderly mom (she's 78 and showing the first signs of dementia - fun!).    I'm trying to utilizing this time at home by going back to school and getting another degree - well, actually 2 Associate's: Computer Information Systems and Mathematics, via my community college's online program.

I'm finishing up Intermediate Algebra this semester (with a solid A!  WOOT!) and trying to plan out my classes for Spring.  I'm trying to decide which math class to take next.  For my computer degree, I need Statistics.  For math, my next class is College Algebra.  Whatever I take, I have to take online - with my mom's health and mental state, on-campus classes are NOT an option.  So, everything would be ""self taught""...ugh.

My question - Which class should I take first?  Would I be crazy to take them at the same time?  Would I confuse myself too much?  (FYI - for the math degree, I have to take quite a lot of math classes, all in succession.)

Thanks in advance for your advice!  STUDY ON!","[""Personally, I would take college algebra first. I found it much easier than statistics. Statistics is really its own thing, though. Some people really get it and enjoy it, and for others it just doesn't click and they have to really work at it. \nAs long as one is not a prerequisite for the other, you technically should be able to take them in any order and will not need material from one for the other. \nFor the math degree, how many classes do you need to take in succession? You may want to take the class toward that degree, because if you have to take, say, 4 classes that cannot be taken at the same time, you will have to take at least 4 more semesters. If you put that class off, you may end up with a semester or two of just taking one class toward that degree and graduating later. "", ""Math BA here.  I work as a tutor at my school's math lab and regularly tutor people from intermediate into college algebra.  It's a small school so there is a steep drop off enrollment numbers in trig and business calculus which is the highest we officially tutor.\n\nI admire your hard work.  Having a solid A is an excellent first step at success in College Algebra which for many is the terminal math course of their undergrad.  That said, unless your community college is a feeder for a nearby engineering school the extent of your precalculus exposure will be the ideas of a limit presented in the form of asymptotes in rational functions and exponentials AND maybe maybe some combinatorics, sequences or matrices.  You will likely not see so-called sigma summation or geometric series.  \n\nIn my opinion you should take advantage of your momentum in algebra and put statistics off for a semester.  Maybe consider it during a summer semester.  \n\nIf your intermediate algebra curriculum is similar to my school's you are likely now finishing with solving quadratic equations, either by plain factoring, square root property, completing the square, or quadratic formula.  You now have seen complex numbers and should be very comfortable with the different cases that arise from the value of the discriminant, eg. complex and irrational solutions occur in conjugate pairs.  \n\nCollege algebra will take you into the higher degree polynomials, 3 and 4, where you will apply leading coefficient test, rational zero theorem, Descartes' rule, and graphical analysis to functions before moving into exponential functions!  \n\nThe familiarity with algebraic manipulation will help in statistics later on.  Good luck!  Mathematics is a beautiful field."", ""I'd do college algebra. You're acing intermediate algebra, and if you take a semester off you'll run the risk of forgetting some stuff and losing momentum. \n\nThat being said, taking both is pretty reasonable unless you're a very weak math student (which you clearly aren't). They're different enough that you're not going to be crossing over what you learned in which class. "", ""Take them at the same time. It won't feel like you're taking two math classes. It'll feel like you're taking one math class and one... I don't really know how to describe it. Stats is its own thing. But both classes are really easy- or at least they should be if you're looking into mathy subject areas for degree options.
